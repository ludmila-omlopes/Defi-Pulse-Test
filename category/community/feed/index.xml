<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Welcome back! This week be had the opportunity to chat with Preston Van Loon, Co-Founder of <a href="https://defipulse.com/cryptex">Cryptex</a>, who offered up lessons he&#8217;s learned building in the cryptocurrency space and what excites him about DeFi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="https://cryptex.finance/">Cryptex</a>’s flagship product is TCAP, which is the Total Crypto Market Cap token. This is a synthetic collateralized asset. The price of TCAP directly correlates with the total market cap value of all cryptocurrencies in the space. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We think this is a really unique product in that there&#8217;s not really a great way for retail investors or any kind of investor to buy into the entire market. Maybe they think that cryptocurrencies in general are a good thing and going in the right direction, but they may not really have the ability to analyze and understand all the protocols, either a technical level or a user level. But they know that cryptocurrency is the future. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So with something like TCAP, they&#8217;re able to get exposure to the entire market and be able to capture the value of cryptocurrencies from an investment perspective.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So, the scalability trilemma is this famous problem where you have these three properties to the blockchain, and you want to be able to increase any aspect of that trilemma without taking away from something else. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">That being said,<strong> you want it to be secure, fast and decentralized.</strong> And so you can go fast if you take away the decentralized aspect of it, maybe you&#8217;re running like the super node. Or you could go fast by making it cheaper to do and not verifying signatures or really just making it less secure in that way if you go faster. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>I think that scalability is the problem that we need to solve, and most urgently.</strong> I think that the other two aspects, decentralization and security are also important, security being the most important, I think, in terms of a blockchain where there will always be some aspects of centralization. And that&#8217;s fine to some extent. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We always want to make it as decentralized as possible, but security being number one, if you violate the security assumptions of a blockchain, it&#8217;s no longer secured, it&#8217;s game over or could be game over essentially. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">And then scalability coming second, it&#8217;s like, you want it to go fast without really taking away from too much of the other aspects.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>In order to have a long lasting community, you need to keep the community engaged. </strong>You know, we&#8217;re building this together, <strong>it&#8217;s not just the Cryptex team building out cool, exciting products. We&#8217;re building it together as a community.</strong> </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">And it&#8217;s still initially by the Cryptex team, but going forward it&#8217;s built by the community almost in every aspect we could think of. Community members are hired to the Cryptex DAO, continuing development and outreach and these kinds of things. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">On an ongoing basis, we have meetings with the community, kind of bringing everybody together, figuring out how the DAO should operate and what the next steps should be. Either on the forums and our discord channel or on a frequent Zoom call that we have every other week.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>I think that DeFi is really not getting the full attention that it should.</strong> The thing that <strong>I&#8217;m most excited about with DeFi is this concept of being your own bank.</strong> And that&#8217;s sort of something that we strive to do with blockchains in general.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">But in terms of really just earning interest with your capital, with your savings in traditional finance, it&#8217;s not very rewarding to do that, but in a DeFi space, you kind of take out the middleman there, being the brick and mortar banks who are making money off of you. You could be making that money yourself in DeFi space, there are a lot of really creative products out there. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Something upcoming that I think is really cool is <a href="https://element.fi/">Element Finance</a>, it&#8217;s built by some of the people who&#8217;ve done a lot of really exciting work on the Ethereum protocol. And this project in particular helps users basically earn interest on their ether without sacrificing or locking up the principal or the full principal for the entire time. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So it&#8217;s a really interesting project in that way, that you&#8217;re able to deposit the ether. Then you can sell off your principal and just earn the interest that you would have at the end of the maturity of the contract.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There&#8217;s a lot of lessons that I have learned. I&#8217;ve been working on blockchain stuff for about three years, a little more, and it&#8217;s a very different world from traditional software development. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So from the development perspective, it&#8217;s all about really making sure that things behave the way you expect them to. Getting there takes lots of vigorous testing being, unit testing at the code level, and testing it, on some sort of testnet or simulation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">And then of course there&#8217;s a lot of testing around the usability of things. Actually getting in there and playing with it, not just on an automated level, but really being careful about, and putting a lot of thought into the design is important because once you&#8217;ve deployed it, it can be difficult to upgrade it or modify it any way. So if you release it with a bug, you may be stuck with a bug forever. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The lesson is: you got to really plan things out and move carefully, it&#8217;s the opposite of move fast and break things. </strong>It&#8217;s move slow and make sure you did it all right so you don&#8217;t get stuck or have to do it again.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I&#8217;m a big fan of the ultrasound money meme. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-1024x573.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-9386" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-1024x573.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-300x168.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-768x430.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-1536x860.jpeg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-2048x1147.jpeg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-585x328.jpeg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Basically, it&#8217;s kind of a meme for Bitcoiners where they say that Bitcoin is sound money, mostly due to the fixed supply cap. And with Ethereum&#8217;s new monetary policy coming out towards end of the year, it becomes instead of an inflationary asset, it becomes deflationary. And so the meme&#8217;s argument is that if a fixed supply is sound money, then a deflationary supply is even more sound. And that next level of sound money is ultrasound money. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So I liked that meme, you can see it in a lot of Ethereum, Twitter names and profiles that have the bat and the speaker that&#8217;s ultrasound meme. And I&#8217;m really a big fan of that because it kind of brings light to these two different types of monetary policy between Ethereum and Bitcoin.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Chaz Schmidt:</strong> <em>Hello @Hamzah and welcome everyone! Thanks for joining us today.</em></p>



<p><em>Hamzah will be answering the questions we&#8217;ve collected from the community throughout the week. Shout out to all of you who submitted questions!</em></p>



<p><strong>How are you today Hamzah?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah Khan:</strong> I am good, thanks for having me guys, Real pleasure being with one of the most respected communities across all of DeFi.&nbsp;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>The pleasure is all ours. Hamzah is Head of DeFi at Polygon for those who may be unfamiliar.</em></p>



<p><em>Let&#8217;s dive right into the questions:</em> <strong>Can you give a brief intro to Polygon (formerly Matic Network) for the audience?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong> Polygon is an Ethereum scaling solution with a suite of projects including the Plasma and PoS chain. Ton of DeFi, NFT and Gaming activites happening on all and we are happy to scale ETH with our unique, battle tested and production ready chains.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Polygon has become very popular indeed.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Community members wanted to know: </em><strong>What’s the difference between Proof of Stake (PoS) Bridge and the Plasma Bridge?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah: </strong>Definitely &#8211; PoS and Plasma are different security standards that support different assets right now. PoS &#8211; Proof of Stake validated by our 100 validators currently on ETH mainnet which share (not completely) its security. Plasma is another L2 scaling solution popular back in 2018, also supports MATIC tokens (because they were the first ones on the chain) and has 7 days withdrawl time (trx finality) &#8211; inherits completely from ETH&#8217;s security.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Thanks for that thorough answer. You actually touched on a question we received on Twitter this week:</em> <strong>Why might a DApp prefer a sidechain over a standalone rollup solution?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong>&nbsp; Definitely happy to provide more clarity on this, I have multiple reasons &#8211;</p>



<p>1. Battle tested &#8211; Polygon PoS and Plasma chains have been production ready for more than a year with increasing decentralization and optimizations in checkpointing to ETH whilst maintaining a decent UX in exit times. Gratefully we havent seen any malcious activity or failure of the network till now. The community completely understands the EVM friendly nature of the chain and can quickly deploy (unlike porting period of months on some other solutons).</p>



<p>2. Spectrum of decentralization &#8211; Our PoS commit chain is not the most decentralized solution out there and we are aware of it. To improve on this front we have increased validators from 80 to 100 in less than 2 months and continuing to do so more in the future. On the decntrlzn spectrum, we are in between rollups and pure sidechains, but this solution is live and moving closely towards gradual decentralization like addition of multisigs and eventual timelock governance</p>



<p>3. gas fees &#8211; Community IMO is overestimating the gas fees reduction on some of these rollups. They are significantly centralized on the L2 side as some of them will start with a single operator and no clear roadmap to decentralize. On the gas fees because they send all trxs to ETH mainnet and pushing proofs on-chain will congest ETH more and the gas fees on these L2s will atleast be single digit dollars if not more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is fine for &#8220;whales&#8221; and &#8220;shrimps&#8221; but not the retail that #DeFiForAll Polygon is trying to include. So we are very well positioned in that sense not just for DeFi but others too.</p>



<p>I hope that answers a few of the doubts.&nbsp;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>You make excellent points regarding Matic Network, its history, and more importantly where it is headed.</em></p>



<p><em>I for one was excited to see the </em><a href="https://blog.polygon.technology/announcing-polygon-sdk-the-gateway-to-multi-chain-ethereum-8ad580ec387"><em>Polygon SDK announcement</em></a><em> earlier this week.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Speaking of the future&#8230;. </em><strong>What will the competitive landscape for scaling solution protocols look like in the future &#8211; let&#8217;s say 5 years (e.g. consolidation or growth)? </strong><em>Though feel free to adjust the time frame as you see fit.</em></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong> I think it&#8217;s super growth time for L2s as that&#8217;s the way DeFi scales to a million users. We believe it won&#8217;t be a winner takes all market &#8211; Ethereum hosts a vast variety of applications and application specific L2 solutions might also come up, and that would be very interesting. As a matter of fact, SDK caters exactly that avenue.</p>



<p><strong>CS: Can you elaborate a bit on what the SDK means for Polygon and the wider ecosystem?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong> It means Ethereum can finally be a multi-chain system &#8211; in an increasingly fragmented space it will become hard to scale on specific L2s. Polygon with the suite of shared security and standalone chains brings a modularity that we have seen by AWS in Web2. Projects can use OR, ZK, Standalone or even Enterprise solution chains as per their use case.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>That&#8217;s really cool sounding. We’re running a bit short on time, but I believe we have time for one more question.</em></p>



<p><strong>What area or solution that is not currently being worked on do you Hamzah think is the most important for the Ethereum ecosystem?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong> Learning from other L1s and incorporating some of their best practices. Ethereum became what it is today by challenging the status quo of Bitcoin community. But if we remain maximalists in this sense and not willing to adapt it will become difficult for us to compete with other L1s in the not-so-distant future.</p>



<p>Not sure if the community will hate me for saying this or not, but yeah my 2 cents. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>I think anyone can appreciate honesty. Especially if it comes with good intentions.</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you for making time in your busy schedule to be with us.</em> <strong>Do you have any else you’d like to share before we wrap things up?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong> Nope, thanks a ton for having me.&nbsp;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Well thanks again for coming Hamzah. We know you have to go, but we appreciate you coming today</em></p>



<p><em>And thank you all for attending today!</em></p>



<p><em>See you next time for another intriguing AMA.</em></p>

<p>Previously, providing liquidity to automated market maker (AMM) projects in DeFi has been a manual and somewhat tedious process. You source the required amount of tokens for your desired pair, approve token contracts, pay gas fees to deposit, and then if you’re looking to farm further yields you might go and stake your new liquidity provider (LP) tokens, which takes yet another transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You go through all these steps only to endure the risk of impermanent loss (IL) while you serve as an LP. Now, though, <em>it is</em> possible to provide liquidity and earn DeFi yields simply and without the risk of IL. That’s because <a href="https://impermax.finance/"><strong>Impermax</strong></a>, a decentralized marketplace for borrowing and lending LP tokens, is offering a game-changing new way to participate in LPing called <em>Indirect Liquidity Providing</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uqVZj40ev81y7CVPscU_0BVsVbfsJJdOBw4VjUjsn0FlIU629FU_0Xnxwji7vd5dEYl2qaZZDIR_l1n-QHD0xv5zWwFbETl4airftBWwWfbQF-iVk3VMoZFQHmnrTNA_r6ThM_Ui" alt=""/></figure>



<h2><strong>A new way to LP in DeFi</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Indirect Liquidity Providing</strong>, a novel way to participate in DeFi liquidity markets, involves earning yield by <em>lending </em>assets to other LP token holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="http://defipulse.com/impermax">Impermax</a> system this works through the protocol’s lending pools, which use LP tokens like ETH-DAI Uniswap V2 LP tokens as collateral. These pools only allow borrowing and lending around a given pool’s token pair, such as ETH and/or DAI if you’re borrowing against ETH-DAI UNI-V2 tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accordingly, DeFi users can now supply a <em>single </em>token to an Impermax lending pool to earn yields indirectly through an AMM, all while facing essentially no threat of impermanent loss. This is in stark contrast to the IL risk users take on when they directly serve as LPs!&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://impermax.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="555" height="329" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2z3yCV7xfTT6sA_rTwCtmQN47qNPcMAicueZTYMiZ9_DZP4SQEghbdR73-3fxZvHPL7D7fsnXJdHC6-v0Kx8kU2EKtvRsAkit5QQp6aO0JtDS4YkjtZBE23z9RhMDhPy2KOzLGHc"></a></p>



<p>In this way, we can understand Impermax as an <strong>Indirect Liquidity market</strong>. Users lend their assets to yield farmers, who then convert these assets into further LP tokens in order to boost their own yields. These yield farmers take on all the risk of impermanent loss while paying out a portion of their yields to pay back their loans from Impermax lenders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Yield farming made simple</strong></h2>



<p>A key advantage of the Indirect Liquidity Providing system is that it offers lenders an easy, simplistic avenue for yield farming. This is because Impermax’s lending markets do away with having to go through multiple steps like acquiring LP tokens and thereafter staking them in order to farm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, <strong>lending through Impermax offers a casual, one-step, staking-like process for yield farming</strong>: you deposit a token into your lending pool of choice, and voila, you’re earning yield and can claim it any time. That’s about as simple as it gets when it comes to farming opportunities in DeFi, so these farms also minimize the need for transactions, which can really add up gas-wise with other traditional yield farms!&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi beginners want entry-level yield farms, and DeFi veterans enjoy simple passive earning opportunities, so Indirect Liquidity Providing has a little something for everyone. This will ensure Impermax will continue to have an important role to play in DeFi, as there’s big demand for simple yield farming solutions while many AMMs are becoming increasingly complex, like Uniswap V3.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Good for DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>To compete with traditional finance, DeFi will need to continue being a liquidity blackhole and continue attracting in more money. More money equals more efficiency, and more efficiency means better options for users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, <strong>Impermax’s Indirect Liquidity Providing innovation represents a benefit for all of DeFi</strong>, insofar as this new lending style makes it easier to provide liquidity to AMMs and can thus help these AMMs grow faster than they would have otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In time, then, we might even see some AMM projects incentivize and promote Impermax’s lending markets since these markets can serve as a direct and increasingly important pipeline of activity to them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Learn more about Impermax</strong></h2>



<p>Impermax is a first-of-its-kind protocol for borrowing and lending LP tokens, so be sure to keep the project on your radar as it now works on adding support for LP tokens from Uniswap V3 and other major DeFi trading protocols like Curve and SushiSwap. You can learn more by following Impermax on <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpermaxFinance">Twitter</a> or by joining in on the project’s community discussions on <a href="https://discord.gg/XN739EgG4X">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ImpermaxFinance">Telegram</a>.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another week, another intriguing chat to share with you all. For this week&#8217;s Founder Fireside Chat, we spoke with Ross Middleton, Co-Founder of <a href="https://defipulse.com/deversifi">DeversiFi</a>, about the leap forward in technology that rollups represent for our industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">DeversiFI is a layer-2 exchange built on Ethereum. When we set out 2 years ago, we wanted to give people all the features and benefits that they were used to from trading on a large centralised exchange, but without giving up control of their funds. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We launched on the StarkWare validium technology 10 months ago to launch the first scalable &amp; private DEX that offers incredible aggregated liquidity for major pairs. Trading &amp; Swapping on DeversiFi is private &#8211; privacy and aggregated liquidity are two of the main differentiators vs other order book DEXs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think all three are important aspects. For those who haven&#8217;t encountered DeversiFI before, DeversiFi is a layer-2 exchanges that uses zk rollup/validium technology to achieve scalability without sacrificing security or decentralisation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We examined a number of different scaling solutions (and built one or two ourselves) before landing on zk rollup technology as rollups really do solve the scalability trilemma.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Building a product that people find useful and can actively be a real part of is key in building a long lasting community. <strong>If you give people a unique tool that solves one of their daily pain points then they are only too happy to provide feedback and put their time into making your project even better.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am biased here but Layer-2 really is the future. All of these &#8216;Ethereum killer&#8217; layer-1 chains are having their moment in the sun because fees on Ethereum are so high at the moment. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We have operating Layer-2 exchanges on Ethereum that allow people to trade &amp; swap without paying any gas at all. <strong>Within 12 months we will also start to see Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible rollups, bridges and CEX on/off-boarding. There may never be a reason for anyone to every touch Layer-1 Ethereum ever again, let alone another blockchain.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So many! We launched at the bottom of the bear market in 2020, before DEXs and DeFi was really a thing. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We had an existing DEX that settled every trade on-chain, but it was taking up a lot of time to support and interfered with our ability to raise financing as people thought it was our main product. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In hindsight, we should have stopped supporting our old product and focused entirely on the new one. There are so many other lessons that we have learned as a team but we don&#8217;t have time to go into more than one of two!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I like the &#8216;waiting for Eth 2.0 to launch meme&#8217; the most because <strong>we actually don&#8217;t need Eth 2.0 to fully launch now that we have a whole ecosystem of rollups that is springing up.</strong> I see rollups as a way to scale Ethereum for the long run, not just whilst we are waiting for execution sharding.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Chaz Schmidt:</strong> <em>Hello and welcome @everyone ! Thank you for joining us today for an AMA with Simone Rigolon, Founder of Impermax.</em></p>



<p><em>Simone will be answering questions we&#8217;ve collected from you, the community, throughout the week. Special thanks to everyone who submitted questions for today&#8217;s AMA.</em></p>



<p><em>Thanks for joining us Simone.</em> <strong>How are you today?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone Rigolon</strong>: Hi Chaz and DeFi Pulse community! It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m very good, and you?</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I&#8217;m doing quite well. Thanks for asking.<br><br>To start things off, can you share a little about Impermax for the audience? </em><strong>What is Impermax?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Impermax is a decentralized lending protocol designed around LP tokens.</p>



<p>It allows borrowers to use LP tokens as collateral to take loans. This enables them to enter in leveraged positions on their LP tokens.</p>



<p>On the other hand lenders are able to &#8220;indirectly provide liquidity&#8221; to Automated Market Makers by supplying their tokens to the borrowers. Lenders are able indirectly earn from AMMs trading fees without any exposure to impermanent loss.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Very cool. You touched on a point that piqued the community&#8217;s interest earlier this week on Twitter. </em><strong>Can you explain lndirect Liquidity Providing for those unfamiliar with the concept?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone:<em> </em></strong>Let&#8217;s start from normal liquidity providing which means supplying tokens to an AMM. This can be a very profitable way to invest capital, but at the same time there is the risk of impermanent loss and there are some complexity that are going to get worse with time. Basicallly it is not ideal for the average user.</p>



<p>Indirect liquidity providing means that you can lend your tokens to liquidity providers. They will borrow them and use them to provide liquidity to AMMs and earn trading fees. In return you will get a percentage of the trading fees they earn. This is ideal for the average user because it can be a &#8220;set and forget thing&#8221;, there is no exposure to IL and it requires only a single token.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong><em> Ahh. So for example with for the USDC/ETH LP token pool you could provide USDC and earn trading fees without exposure to impermanent loss?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Exactly <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Browsing through Impermax ahead of the AMA I noticed that LP token lending pools are isolated. </em><strong>What does this mean for Impermax users and what led to the decision to isolate the lending pools?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>There are many reasons that lead to this decision but the main one is that we wanted to build a protocol that was as permissionless as possible. Keeping all lending pools separated means that anyone can create a new one because even a malicious pool wouldn&#8217;t be able to affect negatively all the other existing pools.</p>



<p>The main advantages of this choice are scalability, security and minimized governance.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>That makes sense. Isolating the pools also isolates risk, mitigating any chance of systematic failure from one bad pair.</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Exactly, it&#8217;s an architecture very similar to the one used by Uniswap for pairs.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>So Uniswap pairs are supported by Impermax today and the community wants to know: </em><strong>What AMM LP tokens do you plan to support in the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>The plan is to add support for more AMMs like Uniswap V3, SushiSwap, PancekeSwap and others. Ideally we would want to support as many LP tokens as possible. Luckily our choice of keeping all lending pairs isolated allow us to scale as much as we want since supporting a new LP tokens doesn&#8217;t have any drawback on the existing ones.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I&#8217;m glad you brought up Uniswap V3 because I saw that on your <a href="https://impermax.medium.com/impermax-road-map-e320fdb4652d">roadmap</a> the other day and wondered how that will work with V3&#8217;s new price curve NFT setup. </em><strong>Can you shed any light on that at this time? </strong><em>We will accept soon <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> if necessary</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> I can&#8217;t give too many details on how exactly it will work because we&#8217;re still researching LP NFTs and the way they can be used as collateral. Some complicated math involved, so it&#8217;s hard to talk about that in an AMA. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Personally I&#8217;m very excited about supporting LP NFTs on Impermax because Uniswap V3 is very capital efficient by itself, and with NFTs enabled to be used as collateral that&#8217;s going to improve even more!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>No worries! The audience can stay tuned for that one. We only have a few minutes left anyways.</em></p>



<p><em>Since we&#8217;re on the topic of the roadmap,</em> <strong>what’s coming up on the roadmap that you’re excited about?</strong><br><br><em>Or even a recent release since you mentioned LP NFTs.</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Many things like new features for the existing app, support for Uniswap V3 support for layer 2 and other networks.</p>



<p>I bet users are going to be very happy once Impermax releases on lower fees networks, but personally the thing I&#8217;m most excited about is Uniswap V3 support, for the reasons I&#8217;ve just talked about. Capital efficiency is key for AMMs in the long term and both UniswapV3 and Impermax are solutions to improve it.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>When you put it like that, it&#8217;s easier to see why on your website, you describe Impermax as “The missing piece to the Automated Market Makers&#8217; puzzle”</em></p>



<p><em>In your own words, </em><strong>how does Impermax complement AMMs and where do you see Impermax fitting into the puzzle?</strong><br><br><em>We&#8217;ve reached 30 minutes. Do you have time to answer this and maybe one other question?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Wow time runs fast. Yes, I have have time.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I know right? Awesome I wanted to touch on one other aspect of Impermax that our community was asking about.<br><br>Impermax introduced a liquidity mining program which rewards users with IMX tokens for borrowing on Impermax.</em> <strong>What was the motivation behind incentivizing borrowing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong> The main reason is to incentivize the protocol usage and attract more liquidity. Impermax needs a lot of liquidity in order for the incentives to really work as they should. Farming is always a good way to bootstrap a new protocol.</p>



<p>There are a few reasons why we incentivized only borrowing and not lending. The main one is because lenders are still indirectly rewarded since the borrowing demand is very high. Not giving the reward to lenders means that they don&#8217;t have to worry about claiming it and instead they are rewarded with an higher supply APR that will compound over time.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Interesting. In other words, borrowers pursuing more liquidity mining rewards earn more trading fees for lenders.<br><br>I think that&#8217;s about all the time we have for today. Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to say?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Not really, I just want to thank you and DeFi Pulse for organizing this event. It was a pleasure to answer these questions.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>You&#8217;re welcome as always. Thank you for coming! I learned a thing or two and I&#8217;m sure the audience found it helpful.</em></p>



<p><em>And thank you all for coming to today&#8217;s AMA!</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Did you know that the combination of how the Earth’s gravity warps spacetime and the speed at which a satellite travels effectively allows satellites to time travel into the future nanoseconds at time? If you wanted to time travel, theoretically you’d need two things: a massive black hole and and an incredibly fast spacecraft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many have described DeFi as a liquidity black hole, sucking in anything that comes near it. And now, there’s a craft capable of speeds fast enough to <em>slingshot</em> us into the future. <a href="https://app.slingshot.finance/"><strong>Slingshot</strong></a><strong> is a next generation decentralized trading platform which aggregates the top liquidity sources in order to give traders like you the best prices, speed and execution on trades.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In late February, Slingshot launched its closed beta with a unique way for users to earn their invite. The first 100 players to complete the race, a sci-fi themed browser game, won access to the beta and NFT prizes for having the best speedrun times. One player even finished the race so quickly they were <a href="https://twitter.com/AgentProtocol/status/1365828515489345537">accused of being a robot</a>. While a race may seem odd, it was arguably the perfect primer for the futuristic look and feel of Slingshot’s smooth trading interface.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://slingshot.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="443" height="46" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9291" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo.png 443w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo-300x31.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>You can now try it for yourself today because <a href="https://app.slingshot.finance/"><strong>Slingshot</strong></a><strong> is live on Polygon</strong>. Slingshot chose to launch their first Liquidity Zone on Polygon because it fit with their mission to provide traders with the best trading experience.</p>



<h2>Slingshot is tailored for a next level trading experience</h2>



<p>To quote its early <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1329235851813953537">teaser</a> video, Slingshot wants you to “fall in love with DeFi all over again.” And to be honest, the video game-like UI/UX of Slingshot is rather alluring. Between the live price chart, trade history, scrolling price ticker, and all the flashes of red and green when token prices update, you feel like you’re behind the console of a trading machine.</p>



<p>Speedrunning was indeed an apt way to introduce users to Slingshot, a trading platform built for speed. The flow of trading on Slingshot is rather intuitive. You can either start by searching for a token to trade using the search bar or click the + sign on the left side to bookmark a token. Next, select whether you want to buy or sell and the amount you want to spend. And voila, Slingshot finds you the best price for your trade aggregated from the top liquidity sources.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://app.slingshot.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="506" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-1024x506.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9293" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-1024x506.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-300x148.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-768x379.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-1536x759.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-585x289.png 585w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1.png 1917w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<h3>A polished UI with a buttery smooth trade flow</h3>



<p>When trading bookmarked tokens, this entire process flows smoothly from left to right allowing you to trade incredibly fast, especially on Polygon. While Polygon is the only publicly available Liquidity Zone today, beta users can tell you how awesome it is to seamlessly switch between Liquidity Zones. Slingshot allows you to search for tokens across Liquidity Zones and then filters the list of available tokens according to the Liquidity Zone of the token you selected. So say you’re connected to Ethereum but want to buy MATIC on Polygon. There’s no need to pre-switch your network in Metamask because Slingshot handles this as part of the trade flow. Don’t worry though; you’ll get the chance to see what this is like soon enough.</p>



<p>The more subtle details in the user interface also really add polish to the entire trading experience. For example, when you hover your mouse over the ticker at the top, it feels as if time slows as the scrolling ticker slows in reaction to your cursor. And when you hover over the chart, the cursor becomes a crosshair which follows the line of the price chart. Every little bit adds up to make trading frictionless and fun again.</p>



<h2>Test drive the future of trading with Slingshot</h2>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Chaz Schmidt:<em> </em></strong><em>Hello and welcome @everyone! Thank you for joining us today for an AMA with Clinton Bembry Jr., CEO of Slingshot ( @Clinton | Slingshot ).&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>The AMA will last around 30 minutes and will be made available shortly after for those who could not attend.</em></p>



<p><em>Clinton will be answering the questions we&#8217;ve collected from the community throughout the week. A special thanks to those of you who submitted questions for today&#8217;s AMA.</em><strong><em><br></em></strong><strong><em><br></em></strong><strong>How&#8217;s it going Clinton?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton Bembry Jr.:</strong> Hey Chaz! doing well, hbu?</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Not too shabby. Thanks everyone for showing up for the AMA. Let&#8217;s start off with a rather easy question&#8230;</em></p>



<p><strong>What is Slingshot?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton:</strong> sweet, Slingshot is a decentralized trading platform that aggregates liquidity across DEX protocols (like uniswap, sushiswap, curve, etc.) to offer user sthe best prices on their trades. We place a huge emphasis on user-experience and aim to offer the ultimate trading experience for both DeFi natives and newcomers to crypto!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>This next one comes from the Slingshot Discord where folks are clamoring for more details on Slingshot ever since your initial teaser earlier this year.</em></p>



<p><strong>What will separate Slingshot from all other DEXes already operating? Uniswap, SushiSwap, LinkSwap, DODO, etc.</strong><br><br><strong>Clinton:</strong> so Slingshot itself isn&#8217;t a DEX, we plug our liquidity engine into other DEXes like uniswap and sushiswap etc</p>



<p>By aggregating liquidity and splitting orders between other DEXes we are able to offer much better prices than if you were to trade on an individual DEX<br><br>Slingshot isn&#8217;t just about the best prices, but also unparalleled user-experience</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I know for many DeFi users fees can be a big factor when it comes to user experience.</em><br><br><strong>How does Slingshot plan to support trading on layer 2 or multiple chains?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>definitely, many people (myself included) got priced out of trading on Ethereum L1</p>



<p>At launch we will suport trading on Polygon, which is an Ethereum L2/sidechain. The tx fee on Polygon for a trade is as low as $0.0002, compared to Ethereum which can be a $100+ fee per trade</p>



<p>At Slingshot we&#8217;re all about pricing people back into DeFi <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong><em> Sounds good to me. I like low fees. I saw in your Discord that Closed Beta users have been able to use Slingshot on Polygon already.</em></p>



<p><strong>What has been the most useful feedback from the closed beta so far?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton:</strong> Our polygon support is a result of the feedback we received from our earliest beta users. Due to high fees they were being forced to turn back to the world centralized trading. We began working on L2 support immediately and shipped it a few weeks later.</p>



<p>other than that &#8211; it&#8217;s been very helpful in general to hear which features users want to see to aid in their trading flows</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>That actually leads straight into my next question which is:</em><strong> What features of Slingshot are you most excited for the public to see?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>aside from the lightning fast L2 trading + unbeatable prices, i&#8217;m personally excited for people to experience all of the real-time, on-chain data we pump through our platform.</p>



<p>Every time a block get&#8217;s mined we parse all trading activity and surface it to our users and it makes for a visceral experience!</p>



<p>oh also &#8211; our price charts are custom made and look really cool :sunglasses:</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I can attest to this personally. I&#8217;ve gotten a chance to test Slingshot in the beta and I found myself getting lost in it like it is a game. The flow from seeing a price change on the ticker, clicking it to select the token, and executing the trade was incredible. A community member wanted to know more about the sci-fi browser game that Slingshot produced where players could win their way into the beta.</em><strong> In their words, &#8220;What was the point of the game?&#8221; And, will other aspects of Slingshot involve gamification?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>the point of the game was&nbsp; to announce our closed-beta and bootstrap an initial user-base, while also having some fun while we build the future of finance!<br><br>I mean, how else are you supposed to announce a beta?</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Solid point haha</em><br><br><em>And it was fun. One player was even so fast they were accused of being a robot</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f916.png" alt="🤖" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>haha yes, a bit of a speed-running competition broke out! as far as I could tell, they were all legit, no bots!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>We&#8217;re reaching near the end now and it&#8217;s been super interesting so far. If you&#8217;re up for it Clinton, we have a couple more of questions before we let you go</em></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>Of course!<br><br><strong>CS: </strong><em>I think the audience would get angry if I didn&#8217;t ask the obvious: </em><strong>When launch?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>soon <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> bahaha<br>forreal though &#8211; very soon<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>We&#8217;ll accept that answer.</em><br><br><strong>Clinton: </strong>we want to get Slingshout out publicly for everyone to use ASAP</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I think that&#8217;s about all the questions we have time for.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you for joining us Clinton. I know I for one am excited for Slingshot to go live.</em></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>awesome, thanks for having me!</p>



<p>quick plug &#8211; we&#8217;re hiring for a lot of roles at Slingshot. If you&#8217;re interested in helping us build the future of trading, <a href="https://slingshot-finance.homerun.co/">check out our job postings here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Haha yes. Be sure to reach out if you fit those roles lol</em></p>



<p><strong>Anything else you&#8217;d like to add before we go?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>that&#8217;s all from me!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Well it was a pleasure talking with you</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you everyone for attending! I hope your curiosities were satisfied.</em></p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/argent_blog_header.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9208" width="1024" height="512"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Welcome back! This week we had the opportunity to speak with Itamar Lesuisse, CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="http://argent.xyz/">Argent</a>. Itamar shares his unique perspective coming from the team behind Argent, one of the most popular DeFi smart contract wallets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Argent is entering an extremely exciting phase. We&#8217;re about to release a big update to our Layer 1 wallet, tailored for people with $50K-$1m plus who need smooth access to DeFi. Essentially it&#8217;s a multi-sig when you want, not when you don&#8217;t. Control and convenience. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Then, this summer, we&#8217;re launching a Layer 2 wallet to make a major push for crypto mass adoption. We&#8217;ll start by using zkSync but will expand beyond that over time. It will be simple, secure, fast and low cost.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The trilemma forces you to think very carefully about first principles and why you&#8217;re actually building. What are you trying to achieve? For who? That then shapes what trade-offs you&#8217;re willing to make. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For us, we believe Ethereum will be the foundation of a new, global financial system that expands economic opportunity. <strong>Of course that needs scalability, but without security and decentralization it would be built on sand</strong>, so we&#8217;re prioritizing those (while pushing for scalability wherever it doesn&#8217;t conflict with those).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s too early for us to say if we&#8217;ve achieved this but we&#8217;re trying to build a durable community by making it truly participatory and not transactional. It&#8217;s not about us broadcasting to an audience but instead about hearing what people think and responding to that. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Being a liquidity provider in DeFi has typically been associated with opportunity costs and risks, particularly the always dreaded risk of impermanent loss. As a liquidity provider, it is important to familiarize yourself with the concept of impermanent loss and determining when the risk to reward ratio is right. But the truth is you have options aside from accepting impermanent loss as an inevitability, you could explore what’s possible with <a href="https://impermax.finance/">Impermax</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Impermax set out to build what they refer to as the “missing piece of the AMM puzzle,” a protocol which allows users to maximize their AMM liquidity pool (LP) tokens. With Impermax, anyone can create a lending market for Uniswap (and soon to be other) AMM LP pairs. Liquidity providers can utilize their LP tokens as collateral to borrow tokens or leverage/multiply their AMM LP positions. Impermax allows users to put LP tokens to work which were once idle leading to more complex strategies and potentially ecosystem growth spurred by increased productivity.</p>



<h2>Maximize the productivity of your AMM LP tokens</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><a href="https://impermax.finance/"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/impermax-blog-thumb-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9190" width="300" height="300"/></a></figure></div>



<p>As previously mentioned, Impermax is <a href="https://impermax.finance/a-lending-market-designed-for-the-lp-tokens-of-uniswap-and-other-amms/">a lending market designed for liquidity pool tokens</a> of Uniswap and other AMMs. Let’s examine how this works behind the scenes. As a borrower, you must first deposit your LP tokens to use as collateral before being able to borrow or leverage. Impermax takes the LP tokens provided as collateral and allows users to borrow the underlying tokens in the LP pair. Interestingly, lenders can choose to lend one or both of the tokens in a LP pair to earn interest without any exposure to impermanent loss. Impermax refers to this as lndirect Liquidity Providing because lenders are basically earning a percentage of the trading fees that borrowers earn but without any impermanent loss.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that lending pools are isolated to each LP token pair and loans are 100% backed by the tokens inside the LP token pair held as collateral. The Time-Weighted Average Price or TWAP provided by Uniswap is used to calculate the liquidation prices of loans to ensure loans remain 100% collateralized. This is kind of cool because it enables Impermax users to permissionlessly add new Uniswap LP tokens and start a lending market for any LP token pair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Borrowers can choose to borrow either token in the pair individually for a unique strategy or simply borrow both to obtain leverage for their desired LP position. Impermax provides an easy to use interface which simplifies the process of leveraging LP tokens up to 10x to a single transaction. Impermax has a liquidity mining program which rewards users with <a href="https://impermax.medium.com/impermax-tokenomics-34cb3dd66474">IMX tokens</a> for borrowing select token pairs. Since your rewards are based off of borrowing, you can actually multiply your liquidity mining rewards by leveraging select token pairs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/borrowable-collateral-infographic.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9191" width="340" height="312"/></figure></div>



<h2>Use caution when operating power tools</h2>



<p>As with all things in DeFi, nothing is without risk. We’ll be discussing some here but as always we encourage you to do your own research. Luckily, Impermax has a very nice <a href="https://app.impermax.finance/risks">risks section </a>to aid you in your due diligence. Like most lending markets in DeFi, it’s possible that you may temporarily be unable to withdraw tokens as a lender if the lending pool has insufficient liquidity like in the event of a “bank run.” Although it should be noted that the dynamic interest rates are designed to alleviate these issues eventually. And of course, if you borrow or leverage, you face the potential risk of liquidation if you don’t meet collateral requirements.</p>



<p>You should also be aware that the permissionless nature of Impermax lending pools is a double-edged sword that carries unique risks. Since anyone can add a new AMM LP token pair and create a lending market, anyone can add new pairs even if they have low liquidity or are potentially malicious. Luckily, these risks are isolated to individual AMM LP token pairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, Impermax relies on Time Weighted Average Prices from the AMM. This means that if a pair is inactive for a long period of time, the price of the oracle may differ substantially from the market price. Additionally, an inactive pair may not attract enough liquidators to insure loans are liquidated in time which can result in a possible loss for lenders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>You can never quite tell which direction the DeFi community will run with an idea but the writing is on the wall that liquidity providers want more out of their LP tokens. Impermax has designed their product to cater to the needs of these liquidity providers in a permissionless way similar to the AMMs themselves. This is enabled by Impermax’s practical and prudent decision to isolate risk to individual lending pools. Builders don’t have to ask for permission to whitelist their project’s AMM LP pair and can even permissionlessly incorporate Impermax lending pools at a protocol level.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a borrower looking to leverage your LP tokens or a lender looking to earn some extra yield from indirect liquidity proving, you should explore <a href="https://impermax.finance/">Impermax</a> available lending pools today. If you’re unsure or just want to take a test drive, you can test Impermax’s application at no cost on Ropsten testnet with zero risks. Don’t forget to follow Impermax on <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpermaxFinance">Twitter</a> or join the community (<a href="https://discord.gg/XN739EgG4X">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ImpermaxFinance">Telegram</a>) to stay informed on the latest updates.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We&#8217;re back with another thought-provoking chat. This time we had the chance to talk with Sunil Srivatsa, Founder of <a href="http://saddle.finance/">Saddle</a>, about the lessons he&#8217;s learned about importance of community and the power of memes while building their AMM.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We’re building Saddle, an automated market maker for pegged value crypto assets, like tokenized bitcoin, stablecoins, or ETH derivatives.&nbsp; The team is currently wrapping up work on V1 Virtual Swaps (powered by Synthetix), which will enable large, low slippage trades between any type of asset supported by Saddle.&nbsp; These types of swaps suffer from a common flaw on L1 though, which is that they break existing aggregator integrations (e.g. 1inch, Matcha) since they are multi-step trades.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Saddle solves this by being co-located with Synthetix on Optimism’s L2 scalability stack &#8211; we just recently performed our first test trades on Optimism!&nbsp; By porting our Virtual Swap contracts to Optimism, we’ll be able to offer these same swaps with instant settlement and lower transaction fees, which also makes smaller trades viable.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another key differentiator that sets us apart from similar offerings is that all of our code has been open sourced under a permissive license.&nbsp; We’ve since seen several other well known projects build upon our work, including Sushiswap V3, Nerve on Binance Smart Chain, and Snowball on Avalanche!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Different use cases will have different priorities when it comes to tradeoffs between security, scalability, and decentralization.&nbsp; <strong>In decentralized finance, applications are handling large amounts of capital and user funds, and security is generally the most important consideration.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Security lapses, especially ones that involve the loss of funds, are some of the worst events for a protocol’s reputation.&nbsp; The security of user funds is our top priority, which is why we conducted three back-to-back smart contract audits with Certik, Quantstamp, and Open Zeppelin before launching Saddle.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>A common place where you can see this tradeoff in action is how many protocols have a smaller multisig with admin key capabilities for emergency situations</strong> (e.g. temporarily pausing trades if a vulnerability is found).&nbsp; In these cases, protocols are trading decentralization for security.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>It’s vital that community members feel ownership and a sense of belonging.&nbsp; </strong>Compound’s launch of the COMP governance token in June of last year revolutionized community ownership by introducing the concept of giving away network equity to users.&nbsp; This approach was iterated on by Andre Cronje, who popularized the “fair launch” when releasing Yearn.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Contrast this with traditional businesses, where ownership is usually only available to tenured employees or a privileged few.&nbsp;<strong> This new ownership and equity paradigm makes it significantly easier to grow tight knit communities with aligned incentives.</strong>&nbsp; Some examples of awesome communities are the Chainlink Marines and Synthetix Spartans.&nbsp; We’re in the early days here at Saddle, and I’m incredibly excited for what the future holds for all of us!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs.&nbsp; I fell down the DAO and governance rabbit hole in June 2020 when I co-founded Urza DAO, a for-profit DAO focused on staking and liquidity mining opportunities.&nbsp; The DAO has since grown to 24 members and ~$3.5MM in crypto assets under management and I’ve learned a bunch along the way.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">DAOs are an exciting new coordination mechanism and we’re just starting to explore what’s possible with them.&nbsp; <br><strong>Here are a few DAO-related projects I’d keep an eye on:</strong><br><a href="https://coordinape.com/">Coordinape</a>, by tracheopteryx et al at Yearn<br><a href="https://daohaus.club/">Daohaus</a><br><a href="https://withtally.com/">Tally</a><br><a href="http://boardroom.to/">Boardroom</a><br><a href="https://deepdao.io/">DeepDAO</a></p>
