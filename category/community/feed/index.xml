<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We&#8217;re back with another thought-provoking chat. This time we had the chance to talk with Sunil Srivatsa, Founder of <a href="http://saddle.finance/">Saddle</a>, about the lessons he&#8217;s learned about importance of community and the power of memes while building their AMM.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We’re building Saddle, an automated market maker for pegged value crypto assets, like tokenized bitcoin, stablecoins, or ETH derivatives.&nbsp; The team is currently wrapping up work on V1 Virtual Swaps (powered by Synthetix), which will enable large, low slippage trades between any type of asset supported by Saddle.&nbsp; These types of swaps suffer from a common flaw on L1 though, which is that they break existing aggregator integrations (e.g. 1inch, Matcha) since they are multi-step trades.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Saddle solves this by being co-located with Synthetix on Optimism’s L2 scalability stack &#8211; we just recently performed our first test trades on Optimism!&nbsp; By porting our Virtual Swap contracts to Optimism, we’ll be able to offer these same swaps with instant settlement and lower transaction fees, which also makes smaller trades viable.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another key differentiator that sets us apart from similar offerings is that all of our code has been open sourced under a permissive license.&nbsp; We’ve since seen several other well known projects build upon our work, including Sushiswap V3, Nerve on Binance Smart Chain, and Snowball on Avalanche!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Different use cases will have different priorities when it comes to tradeoffs between security, scalability, and decentralization.&nbsp; <strong>In decentralized finance, applications are handling large amounts of capital and user funds, and security is generally the most important consideration.</strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Security lapses, especially ones that involve the loss of funds, are some of the worst events for a protocol’s reputation.&nbsp; The security of user funds is our top priority, which is why we conducted three back-to-back smart contract audits with Certik, Quantstamp, and Open Zeppelin before launching Saddle.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>A common place where you can see this tradeoff in action is how many protocols have a smaller multisig with admin key capabilities for emergency situations</strong> (e.g. temporarily pausing trades if a vulnerability is found).&nbsp; In these cases, protocols are trading decentralization for security.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>It’s vital that community members feel ownership and a sense of belonging.&nbsp; </strong>Compound’s launch of the COMP governance token in June of last year revolutionized community ownership by introducing the concept of giving away network equity to users.&nbsp; This approach was iterated on by Andre Cronje, who popularized the “fair launch” when releasing Yearn.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Contrast this with traditional businesses, where ownership is usually only available to tenured employees or a privileged few.&nbsp;<strong> This new ownership and equity paradigm makes it significantly easier to grow tight knit communities with aligned incentives.</strong>&nbsp; Some examples of awesome communities are the Chainlink Marines and Synthetix Spartans.&nbsp; We’re in the early days here at Saddle, and I’m incredibly excited for what the future holds for all of us!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs.&nbsp; I fell down the DAO and governance rabbit hole in June 2020 when I co-founded Urza DAO, a for-profit DAO focused on staking and liquidity mining opportunities.&nbsp; The DAO has since grown to 24 members and ~$3.5MM in crypto assets under management and I’ve learned a bunch along the way.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">DAOs are an exciting new coordination mechanism and we’re just starting to explore what’s possible with them.&nbsp; <br><strong>Here are a few DAO-related projects I’d keep an eye on:</strong><br><a href="https://coordinape.com/">Coordinape</a>, by tracheopteryx et al at Yearn<br><a href="https://daohaus.club/">Daohaus</a><br><a href="https://withtally.com/">Tally</a><br><a href="http://boardroom.to/">Boardroom</a><br><a href="https://deepdao.io/">DeepDAO</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Never underestimate the power of memes.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tracer-Header.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9089" width="1024" height="512" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tracer-Header.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tracer-Header-300x150.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tracer-Header-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Welcome back! This week we had the opportunity to chat with Ryan Garner, Ex-Augur architect, whose dev team <a href="https://lionsmane.dev/">Lion&#8217;s Mane</a> is partnering with <a href="https://tracer.finance/">Tracer DAO</a> to build innovative financial tools for the future of finance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We are building a protocol for creating financial protocols. We refer to this financial protocol generator as the Tracer Factory. While a few existing platforms allow holders of their governance token to vote on what the developers do next including creating new financial protocols, Tracer is fundamentally different. The Tracer Factory allows anyone to create their own financial protocol with the rules they desire and install it into the Factory. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Additionally, the deployment of new financial contracts does not require any developer skills, and is free except for the unavoidable transaction fee. Because Tracer’s Factory is a metaprotocol that is free to use, it is a gift to the world granting broad access to financial tools of equal and better quality than all existing platforms, with reduced overhead cost. This decimates the ability of existing platforms to rent seek. Additionally, we are different in our commitment to decentralisation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For Tracer,<strong> governance is not an afterthought that comes years after launch like most products, nor is it simply a way for stakers to signal what they request the core developers to do</strong>. Tracer is fully autonomous and decentralised from genesis, and control over governance was claimed by random community members. This governance has the power to start or stop paying any development team and those teams have no control over the Tracer project any more than these pseudonymous governors allow. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Governance will vote to expand the capability of the Factory and fund the development of user interfaces and growth of the ecosystem. Because Tracer has not received funding, there are no angel investors pressuring Tracer to rent-seek or to have any part of the system be proprietary.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">If it were only possible to have a single peer-to-peer protocol, that protocol would ideally have security equal to the value it secures while being as decentralised as possible while being barely affordable for the average user due to limited scalability. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">However, this question is based on a false trilemma by implying that such a choice is up to peer-to-peer protocol developers. This choice belongs to users, and their varied preferences will eventually result in many protocols each tailored to the users needs with all protocols efficiently bridged together. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>We hope that one day such a question will be irrelevant to ask a developer of a protocol.</strong> To that end we are developing a protocol factory; one that allows community members to create custom financial protocols without approval, effort, or funding that can each handle this trilemma in their own way. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Additionally, each of these financial protocols will be compatible with an array of distributed ledgers that likewise handle this trilemma in ways the users prefer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Insurance.</strong> The ability for users of DeFi to lose a small percent of their holdings per year in exchange for <strong>being guaranteed they will not lose their locked funds to protocol failure or system exploits will allow a lot more capital to flow into the fringes of DeFi</strong> where there are more experimental and dangerous ideas, that have a greater chance of creating fundamental and powerful innovation.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>When you look closely, many DeFi projects are a jumble of copied assumptions, code, and methodologies that were never looked at closely from first principles. </strong>When a project is first to market but makes inefficient code, unoptimised formulas, overly cautious design decisions and has system, accounting and operating procedures that are not intuitive…. but seems to be functioning, its surprising how virtually all other DeFi projects will just copy these things with a “if it works, don’t fix it” mentality. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">As a development team, Lion’s Mane has been tempted by this way of thinking, but in each case, have been better off changing our mind, backtracking and spending more time. While the creators of existing projects may be experts in their field, we believe in the words of Richard Feynman: “I define science another way: Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts&#8221;. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The more innovative something is, the more it strikes at the fundamentals and questions first principles. </strong>These are especially important when you are trying to generalise a protocol that others have managed to rig together for a specific use case.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Options trading has become more popular than ever now that anyone can trade from anywhere with a few taps. The barriers to entry have been lowered improving accessibility for the average joe. In case you don’t know, options are financial primitives that give a trader the choice (or the <em>option</em>) to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined strike price at some point in the future. Traders can utilize options to hedge against potential price changes or to speculate on the future price of an asset. As DeFi matures, on-chain financial primitives like options become the building blocks for even more sophisticated financial instruments.</p>



<p>If options trading is what floats your boat, say ahoy to SIREN, a decentralized protocol aiming to carve out a unique market niche by catering specifically to sophisticated users interested in holding and actively trading tokenized options contracts. This nautical-themed on-chain options marketplace launched its alpha release in December 2020 and is about to embark on the next chapter of its journey. <strong><a href="http://sirenmarkets.com/">SIREN Markets</a> is set to launch on mainnet March 1.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/siren-1000x500-1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8932"/></figure>



<h2>SIREN Markets offer seamless on-chain options trading</h2>



<p>SIREN is a decentralized protocol which facilitates a marketplace of fully-collateralized, on-chain options. SIREN protocol tokenizes both the long and short sides of an options contract as ERC20 tokens which enables options to be traded via its AMM design requiring no third-party settling mechanism or order matching to complete option settlement on chain. Siren AMM v2 can trade up to 6 SIREN options contracts which all share collateral and payment assets in a single pool. This enables liquidity to be rolled over when a market expires for a seamless UX for liquidity providers.</p>



<p>It starts with liquidity providers depositing collateral into the SIREN AMM pool. So for the WBTC/USDC calls the collateral asset would be WBTC. When you as a trader go to buy options from the AMM, the collateral held within the pool is used to mint a pair of tokens: bToken and wToken. bToken, which stands for buyToken, is sent to the buyer and gives the holder the right to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined strike price. While wToken, short for writeToken, stays in the pool. If the option is left unexercised, wTokens allow the holder to withdraw the collateral or withdraw the exercise payment from the contract after expiration.</p>



<p>Note, that SIREN AMM v2 only trades bTokens, but not wTokens. Although, the Siren team has stated that trading of wTokens may become available in the future. Users pay a premium to the pool in the collateral asset each time they make a trade. This process results in liquidity providers passively becoming covered option writers, automatically underwriting contracts to meet demand from traders. In addition to collecting premiums, liquidity providers benefit from any slippage in AMM trades and earn SI token rewards from the SIREN <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/expanding-the-siren-lpp-c69969e25d41">Liquidity Provider Program (LPP)</a>. It’s always worth noting <a href="https://docs.sirenmarkets.com/faq/what-is-a-liquidity-provider#risks">the risks associated with providing liquidity</a>.</p>



<h3>Giving sophisticated options traders the right tools for the job</h3>



<p>The tools that options traders have come to rely on in traditional finance were refined over decades and decades. So it only makes sense that these early days of DeFi provide ample opportunity to incorporate and innovate on these tools. SIREN’s design allows traders to easily swap options in and out in order to build complex positions as well as the necessary information to assess those positions.</p>



<h4><strong>SIREN AMM v2 pricing is time-decay-aware</strong></h4>



<p>There are two factors that determine the price of each trade on SIREN v2: spot price and slippage. The spot price is determined using a Black-Scholes model, which takes into account parameters like the underlying price, time to expiration, option strike and implied volatility, coupled with a Chainlink price oracle. Utilizing this formula allows Siren Markets to be time-decay-aware requiring no arbitrage in order to quote reasonable prices. Similar to other AMMs, trades will be impacted by slippage based on the size of the trade and available assets in the pool. In other words, the larger the trade relative to the size of the pool, the higher the slippage. This slippage ultimately benefits liquidity providers as another source of returns for liquidity providers on top of collecting option premiums.</p>



<h4><strong>What is ITM, ATM and OTM?</strong></h4>



<p>These expressions are likely familiar to options traders so we’ll skim through these rather quickly. For more in-depth info, you can refer to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp">Investopedia’s definitions</a>. An ITM (short for ‘in the money’) option which has value because it has a favorable strike price compared to the current market price. As you can probably guess, an OTM (short for ‘out of the money’) option still needs to reach its strike price whereas an ATM (short for ‘at the money’) has reached the strike price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These terms help determine what kind of options traders buy or sell taking into account how that option might behave in the current market. For example, an ITM call may require a smaller rise in the cryptocurrency price to be profitable, but there is less potential upside compared to an ATM or OTM call. So if you believe the market price is going to rise significantly, you might consider buying an OTM call because you’d have a greater potential upside while limiting exposure to loss if the price fell.</p>



<p>These are just a couple examples of the ways traders can make use of different option characteristics to influence their trading strategy. Greeks are another way options traders can assess an option.</p>



<h4><strong>Meet the Greeks</strong></h4>



<p>As Siren is meant for experienced options traders, we’re only going to give a brief overview of <a href="https://docs.sirenmarkets.com/faq/what-are-the-greeks">how option Greeks apply to Siren Markets</a>. To get caught up to speed, you can learn more about these general concepts <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/trading/getting-to-know-the-greeks/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Delta</strong></p>



<p>Delta measures a ratio comparing the difference between the underlying asset price relative to the strike price of the option. The delta of a long call is positive; the delta of a long put is negative. The delta is reversed for short calls and puts. Delta is only a theoretical approximation of your exposure in the underlying asset.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Gamma</strong></p>



<p>If you imagine delta as the &#8220;speed&#8221; of your option position, gamma is the &#8220;acceleration.” The gamma of long options, calls or puts, is always positive; of short options, always negative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more gamma your position has, your position delta can change a great deal and probably needs close monitoring. Gamma is highest for the ATM strike, and slopes off toward the ITM and OTM strikes.</p>



<p>If you think the price of an underlying asset is about to change quickly, you want to buy an option with relatively high gamma. For example, the higher the gamma, the more delta if the underlying asset price moves the way you want it to, and vice versa.</p>



<p><strong>Theta</strong></p>



<p>As touched on before, Theta measures the rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time sometimes referred to as time decay. No one can escape time, not even options. Time decay describes how long calls and puts have negative theta, losing money as time goes on. Short calls and puts are the opposite having positive theta and making money as time passes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Theta is highest for the ATM strike, and slopes off to the ITM and OTM options, and responds to the passage of time and changes in volatility the same way that gamma does. The theta of options is indirectly proportional to gamma. When gamma is big and positive, theta tends to be big and negative. That&#8217;s the trade-off. A position that has a lot of gamma (good for fast changing underlying assets) also has lots of theta that is continuously eroding its value.</p>



<p><strong>Vega</strong></p>



<p>Vega is how much the value of an option changes when the implied volatility of that option changes. Long calls and puts both have positive vega and profit when implied volatility rises. Inversely, short calls and puts both have negative vega and profit when implied volatility falls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more time there is until expiration, the higher the vega is for an option. Vega also depends on where the price of the underlying asset is relative to the strike price of the option. Like gamma and theta, vega is highest for the ATM options, and drops for the OTM and ITM options. So, ATM options with lots of time to expiration are the most sensitive to changes in implied volatility.</p>



<h2>SIREN Governance</h2>



<p>The SIREN Market project was created to bring the features and tools options traders are familiar with from traditional finance to a seamless on-chain experience without sacrificing autonomy. The Siren team understands that a platform built to cater to sophisticated users only benefits from their feedback and collaboration. And so, SIREN’s native token SI is designed to reward early users placing the future of the platform in their hands via protocol governance. Liquidity providers, traders, and market makers will receive SI token rewards in exchange for their participation. By design, the most experienced and knowledgeable users will be given the most influence over the platform to help respond to future market demands.</p>



<p>The SI community will be able to create new option markets and determine the fee rate for writing, closing, and redeeming an option. These fees accrue to SI token holders; although it should be noted that upon launch these fees will be set to 0 to reduce the friction for users looking to explore SIREN Markets.</p>



<p>The first SIREN Liquidity Provider Program (LPP) began in December 2020 and was <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/expanding-the-siren-lpp-c69969e25d41">extended through May 2021</a>. Find out more about SIREN’s SI token and liquidity providing program <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/si-token-distribution-event-cff0be106fc6">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Roadmap</h2>



<p>Looking toward the future, <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/si-token-distribution-event-cff0be106fc6">SIREN’S roadmap</a> details many future upgrades to the platform like expanding the list of available asset pools. SIREN is considering adding SUSHI/USDC, UNI/USDC, YFI/USDC, LINK/USDC pools starting with Sushi. Even further out, SIREN protocol will be modified to allow yield-generating assets to be used as collateral.</p>



<p>Other improvements which option traders may want to keep their eye out for include future interfaces for constructing option spreads and effecting basket trades natively. SIREN also plans to explore layer 2 solutions to improve efficiency and lower fees for its users.</p>



<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>



<p>DeFi is disruptive because it gives everyone access to the same tools and data as the experts. Many users who had never had never previously owned a share in a company or a treasury bond are now active participants in a new financial paradigm. With the increasing popularity of options trading in traditional finance, it stands to reason that on-chain options may play a bigger role as DeFi reaches more widespread adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It boils down to: Do you desire a more sophisticated options trading experience? If so, SIREN would like to invite you to join them in building a platform that suits your needs. This is an opportunity to influence the platform early in its development. <strong><a href="http://sirenmarkets.com/">SIREN Markets</a> is set to go live on mainnet on March 1, 2021. </strong>If you want to know more, we recommend joining SIREN’S <a href="https://t.me/sirenmarkets">Telegram</a> or following them on <a href="https://twitter.com/sirenprotocol">Twitter</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The average person would describe cryptocurrency as highly volatile. And while this is true for many, there are coins designed to reduce volatility or stability commonly referred to as stablecoins. Stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the US Dollar, have dramatically risen in popularity thanks to the utility they provide to users and smart contracts alike. Users tend to gravitate to the narrative of USD pegged stablecoins as a familiar unit of account. However, history has shown that stablecoins pegged to the value of a specific asset or basket of assets don’t always hold their peg. And when they do go off peg, it can quickly diminish the reputation of a stablecoin built on the premise of always being $1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Limiting a stablecoin to always equaling $1 also limits the mechanisms available to a community to bring the stablecoin back on peg. This can lead to added complexity like introducing new collateral types and subsequently undesired risk in lieu of what many would argue is the simpler mechanism: negative interest rates. In the end, many stablecoins resort to centralized custodians to hold USD in a bank somewhere or governance systems that require lots of participation to maintain relative stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflexer’s RAI returns crypto to its roots drawing inspiration from the early days of stablecoins to offer crypto-native stability. RAI is an ETH backed, non pegged stable asset known as a reflex index whose monetary policy is managed by an on-chain, autonomous controller. <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5626157429&amp;iu=/22134506417">Reflexer</a> launched on mainnet on Feb 17, 2021.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5626157429&amp;iu=/22134506417"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reflexer_banner_youtube2__1_-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8909"/></a></figure>



<h3>RAI allows you to trustlessly leverage your ETH</h3>



<p>For reasons we’ll cover in the next section, the function of RAI may be familiar to those with an understanding of MakerDAO’s DAI. DeFi users can borrow RAI via Reflexer by depositing ETH as collateral into what’s called a Safe. Borrowed RAI is subject to an interest rate referred to as the borrow rate. Safes must maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 145%. If a Safe position fails to maintain this collateral ratio, the Safe will incur a liquidation penalty and the protocol will sell collateral to keepers at a discounted rate to cover the debt. Note: there’s also a minimum amount of RAI that must be generated by a Safe. This ensures that in the event of liquidation the Safe has enough collateral to cover its debt and the necessary gas costs and incentives for keepers necessary to liquidate the position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RAI boils down to this: a volatility-reduced representation of ETH. It’s designed to float similar to other currencies and not be pegged to anything. Reflexer relies on a set of protocol parameters including borrowing power and market price to determine the price RAI can be redeemed for (more on this in a bit). RAI was launched with a starting redemption price of $3.14. From this point on, RAI will continue to float while it is managed by the protocol’s on-chain controller. Actually, there’s a chance it never returns to its original redemption price at all. Market forces and Reflexer protocol user incentives influence where the redemption price of RAI floats to. At the time of writing, there are 766 active safes and 24,755,216 RAI in total. You can view the current market price, redemption price, and borrow rate along with other RAI stats <a href="https://stats.reflexer.finance/">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Inspired by the original Dai Purple Paper</h2>



<p>Some of you may recall that the original concept of the DAI stablecoin system outlined in the “Dai Purple Paper” back in February 2018 included negative interest rates. In fact, DAI wasn’t always meant to equal $1 at all. DAI was meant to have a redemption price that would float, producing low volatility but driven by the market.</p>



<p>Reflexer’s RAI aims to fill this void by borrowing many of the concepts from the Dai Purple Paper. Reflex indexes like RAI are designed to reduce volatility, shielding users against major and sudden moves in the market like the<a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-status-report-black-thursday/"> events witnessed on Black Thursday</a>. On a technical level, <a href="https://docs.reflexer.finance/">the system behind RAI</a> is a modified fork of multi-collateral DAI with a few distinct changes. Some of these changes include autonomous feedback mechanisms that control user incentives, simplified variable names, more flexible collateral auctions, long term bounded&nbsp; governance, optional Safe insurance and more. While DAI may have strayed from its early vision leaving its hypothesis untested, Reflexer’s mainnet demo Proto RAI illustrated how an asset can create stability without a peg, relying solely on market forces and redemption price float.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Proto RAI (PRAI) demo ran for nearly 3 months before being shut down on January 25, 2021. More than $612K worth of ETH was deposited into the demo to mint almost 52K PRAI; PRAI’s redemption price started at $2.015 and then floated between $1.937 and $2.06. During this same time period, ETH increased by 350% going from about $400 to $1400. Doing the math, this means PRAI’s redemption price fluctuated less than 4%, demonstrating how Reflexer’s reflex indexes can be a more stable representation of its collateral.</p>



<h2>How exactly do reflex indexes create stability without pegs?</h2>



<p>The money god wills it so. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f5ff.png" alt="🗿" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Or at least that’s the meme the Reflexer community has adopted to refer to the set of on-chain, autonomous controllers that control RAI’s monetary policy. At this point, I think it helps to reiterate that RAI is not a pegged stablecoin, because its redemption price floats. But to fully understand what this means we need to define a few terms key pertaining to reflex indexes:</p>



<p><strong>Redemption price</strong><br>Redemption price is the price that the protocol wants RAI to have on the secondary market (e.g on Uniswap or Sushiswap). The redemption price is used by Safe users to mint RAI against ETH and it is also used during Global Settlement in order to allow both Safe and RAI users to redeem collateral from the system. The redemption price almost always floats and it does not target any specific peg. <em>[insert Pennywise meme of your choice here]</em></p>



<p><strong>Market price</strong><br>This one&#8217;s a little self-explanatory. This is the price that RAI is traded at on the secondary market.</p>



<p><strong>Redemption rate</strong><br>This is the rate at which RAI is being devalued or revalued. The process of devaluing/revaluing RAI consists in the redemption rate changing the redemption price.</p>



<p><strong>Global settlement</strong><br>Settlement refers to the process of shutting down a reflex index and allowing both Safe and RAI users to redeem collateral from the system. Settlement uses the redemption price (not the market price) to calculate how much collateral can be redeemed by each user.</p>



<p><strong>Borrowing power</strong><br>Borrowing power is how many reflex indexes like RAI can be borrowed against one unit of collateral. Each time the system receives a price feed update for its accepted collateral types, the feed data is divided by the redemption price and then divided again by the liquidation ratio in order to calculate the borrowing power. So for example, if ETH’s price is 100 USD, the liquidation ratio is 145%, and the current index redemption price is 1 USD, the borrowing power for ETH is approximately equal to 100 / 1 / 1.45 = 68.96 USD.</p>



<h3>Let’s dive into a few examples to see what RAI looks like in practice:</h3>



<p>When the market price of RAI is greater than the redemption price for a sustained period of time, the redemption rate becomes negative. A negative redemption rate lowers the redemption price. This results in users’ borrowing power being increased as RAI becomes cheaper inside the protocol. The redemption price continues to lower until the market price reaches it. In other words, this process creates a strong incentive for users to sell their RAI or even leverage their collateral to generate more sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>Now, imagine this process in reverse. When the market price of RAI falls below the redemption price for a long enough period of time, the redemption rate becomes positive. This in turn lowers users’ borrowing power which then causes more users to buy RAI to pay down debt or buy it with the expectation that the market price will follow the redemption price. Likewise, this process continues until the difference between the market and redemption price is reduced to 0.</p>



<p>There are a few interesting caveats to Reflexer worth noting including the fact that the system’s desired steady state may not reduce the redemption rate to 0%. There may be a non-zero redemption rate where the redemption price and market price remain relatively close to one another. Additionally, the system can collect stability fees even when the redemption rate is negative. When a reflex index is being repriced because of the redemption rate, the amount of stability fees collected (denominated in the reflex index) doesn’t change.</p>



<h2>Reflexer’s Ungovernance</h2>



<p>If you haven’t picked up on it yet, Reflexer protocol highly prioritizes trustlessness and in pursuit of that end: governance minimization. Reflexer has laid out a multi-stage process at the end of which governance will not control or be able to upgrade most core contracts and many Reflexer protocol parameters will be set autonomously by other external contracts. Before this process could begin, the following conditions would need to be met first:</p>



<ul><li>Governance must not add or plan to add any more collateral types</li><li>All infrastructure for governance minimization must have been audited and tested in production</li><li>Finally, the system must accrue enough surplus in its main treasury so that it can afford to pay for oracle, PID, state management etc costs for at least 6 months.</li></ul>



<p>The list of components to which can be minimized and automated to varying degrees is far too long for us to cover here, but please refer to <a href="https://docs.reflexer.finance/ungovernance/governance-minimization-guide">Reflexer’s Governance Minimization Guide</a> to learn more. A key takeaway is that the first of 3 Governance Minimization Levels is expected to be reached within 14 months after launch (approx. April 2022).</p>



<p><strong>What does this mean for the average user?</strong> The behavior of RAI and other reflex indexes will be more predictable with defined parameters. Furthermore, developers looking to incorporate reflex indexes into their protocol or smart contract will be able to trust that its behavior won’t change undesirably.</p>



<h2>Interesting possibilities enabled by reflex indexes</h2>



<p>Reflexer’s redemption rate mechanism when put in the hands of DeFi developers could be utilized in all sorts of ways. A prime example being a unique money market design that takes advantage of RAI’s changing redemption rate to offer users better interest rates or speculate on the expected market price of RAI in the future. When viewed as an intrinsic interest rate for RAI, you can start to see how the redemption rate can be incorporated into a whole range of products and services from options to portfolio management strategies. Yield aggregators in particular would benefit from unfiltered access to borrowing power allowing them to remove deposit caps or simply be more capital efficient. RAI’s low volatility also lends itself well to being used as collateral for synthetic asset tokens.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>Reflexer offers crypto-native stability while taking an approach previously left unexplored by the DeFi ecosystem. RAI answers the call for an ETH-backed asset with low volatility which many DeFi users have been calling for since the transition away from single-collateral DAI. Beyond individual users, Reflexer’s goal towards “ungoverned,” unfiltered access to borrowing power could prove to be a useful resource to future DeFi protocols. You could say these are uncharted waters in what might be a blue ocean.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DeFi is a fast moving and highly competitive space. While DeFi may level the playing field by allowing anyone to participate, it still comes with risks and has a steep learning curve. When these factors are combined, it’s easy to see how the average user may feel left behind at times. Built by the team at Bloq, <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5620418823&amp;iu=/22134506417">Vesper Finance</a> attempts to lower the barrier to entry for users by striking a balance between professionalism and DeFi’s dynamism in its products. Vesper’s first product — Vesper Grow, originally introduced as “Holding Pools” — offers users an easier way to passively earn a yield with their tokens, though with several innovations including a <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-modularity-48e64c810760">modular</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-multi-pool-3ea7f7325d39">multi-pool</a> design enabling pools to adapt and transition strategies behind the scenes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vesper’s ultimate goal is to create DeFi products with a set-and-forget type experience that adhere to Vesper’s stated <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vespers-core-principles-491c169778e1">Core Principles</a>: longevity, quality, trust, and community. Vesper’s roadmap is guided by these principles, featuring an economic model crafted to align Vesper stakeholders via VSP token incentives and community-created pools (More below.) <strong>Vesper emerges from beta on </strong><a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vesper-launch-date-february-17-2021-c08245cd3f18"><strong>February 17, 2021</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5620418823&amp;iu=/22134506417"><img loading="lazy" width="604" height="179" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ONoLln5Q.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8888" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ONoLln5Q.png 604w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ONoLln5Q-300x89.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></a></figure>



<h2>Vesper Grow &#8211; adaptable pools with more than meets the eye</h2>



<p>In a nutshell, you deposit a token into a Vesper Grow pool, the pool then automatically puts your tokens to work in other DeFi protocols earning a passive return in the deposited token based on your chosen asset and risk tolerance. Vesper pools are scored and placed into two risk categories: <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/the-vesper-view-defining-conservative-vs-aggressive-ac5d44950384">Conservative and Aggressive Pools</a>. Risk scoring assesses the complexity of a pool’s underlying strategy, security of the protocols it interacts with, and the collateral ratios among other technical factors.</p>



<p>At first glance, Vesper may appear similar to other vault-like products, but upon further examination there is more than meets the eye. From a user’s perspective, a Vesper Grow pool represents a “front pool” that all tokens are deposited into. However, pool strategies can deploy tokens to any number of “back pool” strategies. We’ll cover more on how this multi-pool design makes Vesper’s products more adaptable in a bit.</p>



<p>Farmers will be happy to hear Vesper definitely learned a thing or two from last year’s yield farming craze. Vesper Grow cuts down the number of steps involved in traditional yield farming and has also been built with special features catering to farmers. For example, Vesper implemented <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612">EIP-2612</a> across all platform tokens which allows approvals to be made via off-chain signature. This is cheaper and faster, as it doesn’t require a separate transaction solely to approve interactions with these tokens. Another prime example is the sweeperc20 function which allows pools to swap ERC20s accumulated by front or back pools for more of the deposit asset so you won’t miss out on protocol rewards or future airdrops.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What makes Vesper’s approach different?</h2>



<p>When you dive into Vesper, you’ll find there is hidden complexity behind the simple user experience.</p>



<h3>Highly modular, multi-pool design makes Vesper’s products versatile</h3>



<p>Vesper takes the concept of <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/rethinking-money-legos-for-sustainable-yield-strategies-8852d126750d">money legos</a> to heart. As previously mentioned, all Vesper pools have a single “front pool” that is actually made up of modular “back pool” strategies behind the scenes. Each strategy is like a money lego brick which can be swapped in and out without users needing to switch “front” pools. This allows Vesper’s products to be highly adaptable. In other words, Vesper users will never have to deal with pools being abandoned due to outdated strategies or what the Vesper refers to as “strategy fade,” establishing a set-and-forget user experience. Not to mention, this makes it easier for developers to utilize Vesper pools by seamlessly transitioning strategies without requiring smart contract upgrades and constant maintenance for integrations.</p>



<p>Vesper’s multi-pool design also enables earning strategies to be gradually upgraded over time. For example, a pool can start at 100% of an older strategy and keep slowly increasing its exposure to a newer strategy 5% at a time. This upgrade mechanism can be used to limit exposure to riskier strategies eliminating the need to cap deposits or ignore a strategy. Or, it can even allow the community to test out future “beta” pools proposed by community developers. It also enables a “market basket” of strategies, as there is no limit to concurrent strategies via this multi-pool design.</p>



<h3>Structured approach to code audits, testing and deployment</h3>



<p>“Aping” into smart contracts on a whim isn’t for everyone for a reason. Writing a complex smart contract system is hard. Getting it right on the first try is even harder. Users, especially inexperienced users, can all too often get burned by a mistake or bug found in complex smart contracts that “test in prod.”</p>



<p>Vesper takes a structured approach to testing and deploying new code. Vesper Finance has high standards for technical review. New code is audited several times, and potentially re-audited, throughout the formal software development process. Each new strategy or protocol integration Vesper deploys goes through a series of tests and safety checks. New code is run through off-mainnet tests, private mainnet tests, and then a public beta before ever reaching production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vesper users have the freedom to set their own pace. <a href="https://app.vesperdev.net/">DeFi power users can opt-in to experimental pools via app.vesperdev.net if they wish to try out new strategies early.</a> Meanwhile, the average user can be confident that any new pool or strategy available in production (<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5620418823&amp;iu=/22134506417">app.vesper.finance</a>) has been through formal testing and auditing, whether it was developed by the Vesper team or a community member. (More on that below.) This process is not only about safety but it’s also about building trust with Vesper users and the wider DeFi community.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Vesper strives to foster community and drive long-term adoption</h2>



<p>Having a strong community is vital for any DeFi project to thrive. Community is fostered through trust and forming sustainable relationships. Vesper’s stated <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vespers-core-principles-491c169778e1">core principles</a><strong> </strong>are longevity, quality, trust, and community. By design, Vesper inherently vets for quality in its testing and deployment processes. Thorough testing combined with the set-and-forget user experience is likely to garner the trust of many DeFi users. This foundation of trust will be vital when moving forward on Vesper’s timeline towards community-created pools.</p>



<h3>Community-created Pools with Vesper Labs</h3>



<p>Vesper eventually plans to release Vesper Labs, allowing anyone to propose new strategies and pools. Developers whose strategies are adopted by the Vesper community are entitled to 5% of the fees generated for life — the same 5% that the Vesper team would get for pools <em>they</em> create. This generates a strong incentive for community developers to craft more and more innovative strategies. Vesper Labs improves accessibility by opening the door for anyone with talent and a clever strategy to contribute. And when paired with Vesper’s modular design, users enjoy a seamless experience while still benefiting from improved strategies.</p>



<h3>Vesper token incentives designed for sustainability and offer a clear path to decentralization</h3>



<p>The Vesper system has been designed from the start to create a sustainable economic model that ties the products in the Vesper Finance ecosystem together. VSP incentives aim to bootstrap the Vesper community by converting participants into protocol stakeholders. The system also encourages volunteer developers, cutting them in on revenue in a way that puts them on equal footing relative to the Vesper founders. This is key to <a href="https://docs.vesper.finance/community-participation-and-governance/governance">Vesper’s plan towards becoming fully decentralized</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8875" width="768" height="432" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1536x864.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-2048x1152.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1568x882.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<p>As you can see, 95% of the fees generated by Vesper products are sent to the Treasury Box and swapped for VSP, creating natural demand for VSP based on the returns Vesper pools are able to generate for its users. These VSP tokens purchased by the Treasury Box are then distributed to those with VSP staked in the vVSP governance pool. The other 5% of fees goes to the developer who authored the strategy — either a member of the Vesper team or a member of the Vesper community. This revenue model keeps participants engaged and helps ensure the ecosystem’s longevity, funding such activities as engineering, marketing, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At launch, users can earn VSP tokens one of three ways: participating in Vesper’s pools, staking in the vVSP governance pool, and providing liquidity for particular VSP trading pairs. (See more about the <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vespers-tokenomics-an-overview-f342ae5b613f">tokenomics, distribution, and emission schedules</a>.)</p>



<h2>Coming soon: Vesper Earn’s “Directed Pools”</h2>



<p>I couldn’t tell you all about Vesper without mentioning this future feature. While Vesper Grow allows users to deposit “Token A” and get more of “Token A,” Vesper Earn pools (previously discussed as “Directed Pools” at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paTBo4atcAo">BitGive De-Phi conference</a>) will allow users to deposit “Token A” and earn “Token B.”&nbsp; If you’ve been in DeFi long enough, you’ve probably fantasized about taking part of your stack, setting a strategy and turning on the auto-pilot. Vesper aspires to fulfill this dream for DeFi users. <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-vesper-earn-and-programmable-yield-afb2db24974a">Vesper Earn</a> pools take the yield they generate from user deposits and delivers what they call “programmable yield.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, you could set up a directed pool where your yield is used to purchase other tokens, passively diversifying your portfolio. You could even conceivably make a directed pool that splits your yield into other Vesper pools. There are so many different ways you could utilize directed pools. Imagine a pool that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKPm9PH4gXI#t=17m53s">donates its yield to charity</a>. All sorts of initiatives could use directed pools to bootstrap their funding. Or perhaps you like to treat yourself, you could create an income pool that sends you some stablecoin spending money each day. It will be really exciting to see these pools in action.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>It’s easy to take for granted the progress DeFi has made over the past year alone. However, Vesper has clearly been taking notes. From the methodical testing procedure to the attention paid to mitigating “strategy fade” via its <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-modularity-48e64c810760">modular</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-multi-pool-3ea7f7325d39">multi-pool</a> design, Vesper has demonstrated their dedication to crafting a product model that addresses the concerns of its users and forming a sustainable community built on trust. Vesper seeks to foster a global community including support for eight different languages: English, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Russian, and Turkish. It will certainly be exciting to follow Vesper as it proceeds along its roadmap towards Community-created and Earn Pools.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Recent events have made it all too clear to the average user why decentralization has a key role to play...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recent events have made it all too clear to the average user why decentralization has a key role to play in having a fair and efficient market. Futureswap aims to disrupt the multi-billion dollar perpetual futures trading market currently dominated by centralized services. Futureswap takes a different approach with a hybrid between Uniswap and a perpetual futures exchange platform governed by the community. You may remember Futureswap from their <a href="https://medium.com/futureswap/futureswap-lessons-learned-from-a-3-day-alpha-be4e37bc8c52">successful Alpha in April 2020 which ultimately ended early</a> after DeFi users flocked to the platform in overwhelming numbers. In less than 3 days, Futureswap’s Alpha 24hr trading volume grew to $17M and liquidity passed $1M. Erring on the side of caution, the Futureswap team decided to end the Alpha earlier than initially planned.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Now they’re back with something even better, the Futureswap V2 Beta is </strong><a href="https://futureswap.com/"><strong>already launched on mainnet</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The Futureswap V2 Beta includes upgrades like live pricing and higher capital efficiency which aim to provide a perpetual futures trading experience that outperforms <em>centralized</em> exchanges.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-1-1024x494.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8860"/></figure>



<h2>What makes Futureswap V2 Beta special?</h2>



<p>Futureswap is a decentralized exchange platform with an automatic market maker (AMM) design that enables traders to enter leveraged perpetual futures with low slippage. Its automatic market maker (AMM) design provides higher capital efficiency offering up to 10x leverage. According to Futureswap: after $50m in liquidity, Futureswap should have better price execution for a $1m trade than any other decentralized exchange and after $300m it has the lowest slippage compared to centralized exchanges based on the current slippage parameters. </p>



<p>Additionally, Futureswap pools can be very efficient with their use of capital resulting in more stability and potentially high returns for liquidity providers compared to traditional AMM exchanges. Futureswap utilizes what’s called a Dynamic Funding Rate or DFR for short. The DFR is a borrowing fee based on the total trade size designed to maintain the volume balance between open longs and shorts. During times of disproportionate demand, liquidity providers’ pooled assets are used to take up the opposite side of any unmatched trades. So if there were tons of unmatched ETH longs, LPs cover the ETH essentially opening a short.</p>



<p>Long and short volumes are pooled and then the more popular pool is charged the dynamic funding rate and it’s paid to the pool in low demand.<strong> </strong>This mechanism limits extreme volatility and properly rewards liquidity providers for their exposure to risk. The DFR keeps increasing as the disparity grows to disincentivize trades on the popular side. In other words, the longs pay the shorts or vice versa until the sides become balanced. This also means that liquidity providers have the potential to earn more thanks to the DFR.</p>



<h3>Oracle Relayer Network (ORN)</h3>



<p>One of the biggest improvements Futureswap V2 brings is the new Oracle Relayer Network (ORN) which enables instant pricing and real-time trading. ORN has been described as a mesh between a price oracle and a meta-transaction processor node. Futureswap users are able to trade in real-time by signing a message including their order and submitting them to ORN. Then, ORN verifies the signed message and finalizes the trade on-chain at the current price. Transactions will fail if outside accurate price bounds set by ORN to protect users. The Futureswap team is taking further steps to improve the Oracle Relayer Network’s security with audits by <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a> and plans to add more nodes to the network.</p>



<h2><br><strong>How Futureswap works</strong></h2>



<h3>Traders</h3>



<p>As we’ve covered, <a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/">traders on Futureswap can open long or short perpetual future positions with up to 10x leverage</a> in real-time with instant pricing. Perpetual futures on Futureswap have no time limits and can remain open as long as the trader has enough collateral. Traders will either pay or earn the dynamic funding rate when opening longs or shorts depending on whether they are on the popular side of the trade or not. Traders also earn FST token rewards each epoch based on their percentage of close trade volume that distribution period.<br></p>



<h3>Liquidity providers</h3>



<p>Liquidity Providers<a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/pool"> add liquidity to Futureswap pools</a> in equal parts to earn trading fees and FST token rewards. For example, if you wanted to add liquidity to Futureswap’s ETH/USDC pool, you would need $100 worth of ETH and 100 USDC. Once deposited, LP tokens are minted representing your share of the pool. These LP tokens can be redeemed at any time if their liquidity is not in a trade. Liquidity providers earn trading fees for allowing traders to use their liquidity. Liquidity providers also earn FST token rewards as an incentive to further grow Futureswap’s available liquidity.</p>



<h3>Liquidators</h3>



<p>Liquidators monitor the platform for positions that are close to violating margin requirements and send liquidation transactions to close at-risk positions for a liquidator fee. It’s vital to the health and stability of the platform for positions to be reliably closed once they reach their liquidation price. It’s worth mentioning that submitting these transactions does not require the liquidator to provide any value or to take over the trade. They simply close the trade on behalf of the protocol and are rewarded for doing so. Currently, the percentage that liquidators receive is 30% of the remaining collateral up to a maximum (currently set to 500 USDC).</p>



<h2>Futureswap is governed by the community</h2>



<p>FST is Futureswap’s non-transferable governance token which is<a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/rewards"> rewarded to traders, liquidity providers, and referrers each day.</a>&nbsp; FST allows the Futureswap community to propose and vote on changes to the protocol, enabling it to evolve and improve over time. We’ve already mentioned FST tokens a few times covering Futureswap’s various incentives designed to incentivize user participation. <a href="https://medium.com/futureswap/futureswap-governance-token-distribution-d2712c855da5">FST is used to reward the Futureswap</a> users contributing to the growth and adoption of the platform. And since Futureswap is governed by the community, this gives the most active users influence over the future of the platform. In other words, users who participate sooner rather than later after the community grows even larger are more likely to have a larger impact with their contributions and receive more FST rewards.</p>



<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>



<p>Potentially disrupting such a big market like perpetual futures presents an opportunity for Futureswap. Futureswap is designed with the expectations of serious trades in mind. Futureswap’s design with its high capital efficiency and low slippage lends itself well to larger trades for whales and industry traders. Its instant pricing and real-time trading ORN system provides a better trading experience with built-in protections against front running attacks. Futureswap may also continue to provide even lower slippage as liquidity grows over time. FST rewards increase the likelihood of this occurring by incentivizing adoption.</p>



<p>Try <a href="https://www.futureswap.com/">Futureswap</a> today and start earning FST rewards. Also, be sure to check out the Futureswap community on <a href="https://twitter.com/futureswapx">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/ZCcxtu9VxH">Discord</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alpha Homora was a DeFi product born out of practicality. Those familiar with DeFi can tell you that users will go to extraordinary lengths when they spot an opportunity. This proved to be especially true as the yield farming craze reached a fever pitch in 2020 when users would combine various lending protocols to leverage yield farming opportunities. It wasn’t long before <a href="https://alphafinance.io/">Alpha Finance Lab</a> spotted this gap in the market and created Alpha Homora to give users a better way to yield farm with leverage more efficiently while also attempting to minimize the risks involved.</p>



<p>Alpha Homora V2 builds on the popular Alpha Homora V1 yield farming product, supporting more AMM protocols, including Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap, allowing yield farmers to borrow various assets in addition to ETH, and enabling leverage of up to 9x leverage thanks to new partnerships.<strong> </strong><a href="https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/"><strong>Alpha Homora V2</strong></a><strong> is set to launch on Feb 1st.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-1024x549.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8843" width="768" height="412" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-1024x549.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-300x161.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-768x411.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<h2>How does leveraged yield farming work?</h2>



<p>Manually yield farming with leverage required you to take out and manage loans across several lending platforms in what amounted to a nerve-wrecking position that could be extremely hard to ‘unwind’. Using <a href="https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/">Alpha Homora V2</a> is a lot simpler and helps minimize the risks involved (though <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/risk">nothing is risk-free</a>). First, you select a supported liquidity pool from popular exchanges like SushiSwap, Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve that are on Alpha Homora v2 and then supply either or both of the tokens to your desired pool. For example, if you choose the SushiSwap&#8217;s ETH/USDC pool that is on Alpha Homora V2 you can provide ETH, USDC, or both. Note, you don’t need to have equal value of both tokens in order to yield farm with Alpha Homora V2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, you’ll decide whether or not you want to use leverage (which goes up to 9x for selected pools). And then, follow the prompts to confirm and submit your transaction and <em>viola </em>Alpha Homora automagically handles the rest. Users can borrow multiple assets, re-leverage, and deleverage their positions easily in just a few clicks. Compared to doing this process by hand, Alpha Homora can <em>feel like magic.</em> It’s easy to see where the name comes from.</p>



<h1>What’s new in Alpha Homora V2?</h1>



<p>Strong partnerships have shaped the design of Alpha Homora V2. Many of you may have noticed that V2 allows yield farmers to take advantage of significantly more leverage than its predecessor. Behind the scenes, Alpha Homora V2 utilizes CREAM V2’s liquidity to take on leverage for its users. Sometimes referred to as The Iron Bank, CREAM V2 allows whitelisted partner protocols like Alpha Homora V2 to take out loans with less collateral requirements. This results in more leverage for Alpha Homora’s yield farmers and higher interest rates for CREAM V2 users.<br></p>



<p>Alpha Finance Labs worked closely with its partners to enable leveraged yield farming of liquidity pools on Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap. And in an effort to help strengthen its partners’ communities, Alpha Homora V2 will not automatically sell and reinvest the farmed tokens. <strong>At launch, Alpha Homora V2 will feature the following leveraged farming pools:</strong></p>



<p><strong>New leveraged pools:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Curve’s 3pool (USDT, USDC, DAI)</li><li>Balancer’s PERP/USDC</li></ul>



<p><strong>Pools migrated from V1:</strong></p>



<ul><li>SushiSwap’s ETH/SUSHI</li><li>Uniswap’s ETH/UNI</li></ul>



<p>In a nutshell, farmers will be able to leverage USDT, USDC, DAI, and ETH to farm CRV, PERP, or SUSHI tokens with up to 9x leverage. On the flipside, lenders will be able to lend ETH, USDT, USDC, and DAI on day one to start earning interest. The plan is to continue to add even more new pools and migrate more pools from V1 over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those curious, be sure to check out these fantastic posts written by the Alpha Finance team that walks you through Alpha Homora V2 from the perspective of <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-in-yield-farmers-perspectives/">yield farmers</a> and <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-in-lenders-perspectives/">lenders</a>. Alpha Homora is also offering additional yield in the form of ALPHA rewards for both farmers. See <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/liquidity-mining-part-2a">here</a> for more information.</p>



<h2>Migrating to V2</h2>



<p>To ensure a smooth transition, ALPHA rewards will continue for a limited time for those liquidity mining on Alpha Homora V1. Although farmers should be aware that leveraged positions on Alpha Homora v2 will get more rewards compared to those on V1. This creates an incentive to migrate sooner rather than later. Here’s <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/72-hour-countdown/">a step-by-step guide</a> for those looking to migrate.</p>



<h2>What is ibETHv2?</h2>



<p>When you lend out an asset on Alpha Homora, you receive the corresponding ibToken or interest bearing token. ibETHv2 is an interest-bearing ETH token you receive when lending ETH to Alpha Homora V2. Alpha Homora typically has competitive yields for ETH due to the high demand from its leverage yield farming pools. Alpha Finance Lab also runs a <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/trading-volume-mining-part-2b">Trading Volume Mining</a> program which rewards users for supplying liquidity to ibETH/ALPHA and ibETHv2/ALPHA pools.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/o7JpNF2vwiZxUlXbPbEtUtMMlbqUwQM-KpKE5OSCqCYH0jEBrzXPKlkjlCp1E7fk5JD8rQx5sGaQqQaShoaL1BF8_FuqNWS_yV7z5qzmfbBNjFw_L6otv5Yzlfeo2yw2RYBZgEsm" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The ibETHv2/ALPHA pool on SushiSwap <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/72-hour-countdown/">goes live on Feb 3rd</a>. Liquidity providers of this pool will receive ALPHA rewards as well as SUSHI tokens from SushiSwap’s Onsen program. Rewards from Alpha Finance’s Trading Volume Mining program will be reflected in the form of trading fees APY when you remove liquidity (not airdropped to your wallet). Those providing liquidity to the ibETH/ALPHA pool on Uniswap will still receive rewards until Feb 3rd, 1pm UTC.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>Alpha Finance Lab’s initial release of Alpha Homora was well-received by the DeFi community given the immediate utility it provided to yield farmers. Alpha Homora V2 built on this popular platform to provide more utility for its users and value for its partner protocols. Key partnerships like the utilization of CREAM V2’s Iron Bank will allow Alpha Homora V2’s users to achieve higher levels of capital efficiency. It’s undeniable we’ve entered a new era in DeFi where partnerships can give you an edge more now than ever. So it will be very interesting to see how such a deep protocol level partnership influences the future growth of both platforms. Regardless of how things pan out, Alpha Homora V2 users will reap the benefits in the meantime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There’s no doubt that 2020 was a wild ride for everyone, especially for anyone involved in DeFi. When you look back at the year, it’s honestly hard to wrap your head around how much things have changed in our community. There are so many projects that launched this year that have become core to the foundation of decentralized finance. Many new projects rose to fill the needs of the ecosystem and many more challenged our preconceived notions of what was thought possible or where DeFi was headed at the start of the year. To round out the year, we thought it would be best to take a moment to celebrate the Top Builders in DeFi of 2020 as nominated by you in our first ever community survey. </p>



<h2>Top Builders in DeFi of 2020</h2>



<p>Without further ado, here are the results:<br><br>Andre Cronje won DeFi&#8217;s MVP builder, engineer, and top project lead of 2020. Fellow YFI proponent Banteg came in second for the top engineer in DeFi of 2020.<br><br>Argent won the top UX/UI of 2020 with honorable mentions going to both DeFi Saver and Synthetix.<br><br>Ryan Sean Adams won DeFi&#8217;s top communications lead of 2020.<br><br>Anthony Sassano won DeFi&#8217;s top community manager of 2020.<br><br>As many guessed, Samczun won DeFi&#8217;s top white hat hacker and top auditor of 2020.</p>



<p>Kudos to all of you and your hard work! DeFi wouldn’t be what it is today without your contributions!<br><br>Now on a more personal level, we’d like to highlight the ways we here at DeFi Pulse have grown in 2020.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Adapters</h2>



<p>It feels like forever ago that we released the <a href="https://github.com/ConcourseOpen/DeFi-Pulse-Adapters">open source adapter framework</a> that now powers our metrics on the DeFi Pulse leaderboard in February 2020. In the past, we had to learn each project and code their adapters ourselves. This new framework allowed projects to collaborate with our team making the listing process faster and ensuring TVL metrics were measured accurately.

<h2>Setting new records for Total Value Locked (TVL)</h2>



<p>The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi grew exponentially during 2020. With more than $14B TVL currently, this was a year of massive growth across all DeFi categories. We saw the birth of dozens of new projects, the emergence of new ways of distributing ownership to the community, the consolidation of open orgs as a novel coordination system, and massive technological experimentation that brought tremendous innovation to DeFi. One can&#8217;t help but wonder what DeFi&#8217;s growth will be in 2021 and what new innovations we will witness. But one thing is for sure, though: these are still very early days, and we&#8217;re only beginning to see what the future of finance will look like.</p>

<p>It seems hard to believe that we were celebrating that the <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/1-billion-tvl-in-defi/">(TVL) had hitted the $1B</a> mark for the first time less than one year ago.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Data</h2>



<p>In April 2020, we<a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/see-the-bigger-picture-with-defi-pulse-data/"> released</a> <a href="https://data.defipulse.com/">DeFi Pulse Data</a> combining DeFi Pulse’s popular metrics with data from Concourse Open’s other popular services’ APIs like <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/">ETHGasStation</a>. Whether you’re writing a blog post analyzing DeFi or building an application that needs accurate gas prices from ETH Gas Station, any task benefits from the right information. We’ve been thrilled to see what the community has done with our data at their disposal.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Drops</h2>



<p>We launched DeFi Pulse Drops, a promotional series where we partnered with projects to inform the community about their latest features, releases, and builds. All in all, we provided in-depth analysis of the following projects throughout 2020: <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/futureswap/">Futureswap</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/balancer-start-liquidity-mining-and-earn-bal-tokens-today/">Balancer</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/mcdex/">MCDEX</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/introducing-mstable/">mStable</a>, Rari Capital <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/rari-capital/">v1</a> and <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/rari-capital-v2/">v2</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/aco/">Auctus</a>’s ACO, Akropolis’s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/delphi/">Delphi, Perpetual Protocol</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/lien/">Lien</a>, Hakka’s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/3f-mutual/">3F Mutual</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dextf/">DEXTF</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/deversifi-nectar-beehive-v1/">DeversiFi</a>, and <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/harvest-finance-drop/">Harvest Finance</a>.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Farmer</h2>



<p>This year’s most important trend within the DeFi space was, without a doubt, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/the-yield-farming-frenzy-and-its-impact-on-defi/">yield farming</a>. Ignited by the launch of the COMP governance token in June, farming developed into one of the key strategies most projects relied on to attract capital to their platforms. By distributing ownership of their protocols to the DeFi community via liquidity incentives in the form of governance tokens, projects grew the liquidity of their platforms exponentially, making the TVL break all-time highs consistently during most weeks of Q3 and Q4.<br><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZmckhJ5sGa2qwaeDds0vUdEHjjJvKk1Rx1Fh4mK4frzcfO42WtTjPBbHMCTTkCjenkiOFIe2ImQKiCVd1I_Jwo3xrhjlP3W7cw6SCJzEl8EA_-6_Pz0i6Wo1PZjpsmZr--tl_-oS" width="624" height="112"></p>



<p>In early August, we launched the <a href="https://yieldfarmer.substack.com/">DeFi Pulse Farmer newsletter</a> to extensively cover this massive trend and get to the heart of the most critical innovations in the space. Currently at edition #21, DeFi Pulse Farmer also offers premium subscribers access to the Alpha Tractor and Protocol Express series. You can <a href="https://yieldfarmer.substack.com/subscribe?utm_source=menu&amp;simple=true&amp;next=https%3A%2F%2Fyieldfarmer.substack.com%2F">sign up to DeFi Pulse Farmer here</a>.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Index</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi">DeFi Pulse Index</a> (DPI), a capitalization weighted index built on Set Protocol’s V2 infrastructure consisting of the most popular DeFi tokens available on Ethereum was<a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-pulse-index/"> launched in September 2020</a>. DeFi Pulse Index was the first of its kind, an index of decentralized finance that wasn’t synthetic or a derivative but rather you own the underlying DeFi tokens and can redeem them using your DPI. Much like our Total Value Locked (TVL) metrics, we aimed to make DeFi Pulse Index a standard the community could stand behind. At the time of writing, DPI is the leading DeFi index token with 5769 holders and a market capitalization of over $25M.</p>

<h2>DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade</h2>



<p>In October 2020, the <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/introducing-the-defi-pulse-economic-safety-grade/">DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade was released in partnership with Gauntlet</a> and added to <a href="https://defipulse.com/compound">Compound</a> and <a href="https://defipulse.com/aave">Aave</a>’s project pages on DeFi Pulse. As the name implies, each Economic Safety Grade is a 1 to 100 grade that allows users to more easily quantify and compare the economic risks of using on-chain protocols. Grades are created by running simulations utilizing data from centralized and decentralized exchanges combined with on-chain user data to estimate market risks. For a more in-depth explanation of the simulation model, we recommend you read this <a href="https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/understanding-risk-in-defi-f64574593979">blog post from Gauntlet</a>.</p>



<h2>Bitcoin at Work</h2>



<p>Marking the last major release for DeFi Pulse in 2020, our team <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/introducing-bitcoin-at-work/">unveiled a new page </a>highlighting the use of Bitcoin in the DeFi ecosystem called <a href="https://defipulse.com/btc">Bitcoin at Work</a>. We worked with 10 different teams from all across the industry to support a wide variety of BTC tokens at launch including: WBTC, RENBTC, HBTC, sBTC, tBTC, imBTC, oBTC, acBTC, pBTC, and BTC++. Thanks again to the team’s who coordinated with us on this launch. Aside from recognizing the hard work and growth of this sector, we hope the metrics and information included in this new page will help DeFi users discover new possibilities and make more informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/espfahPdgGdQCx3GUwVEmNd8Wv4-D10oKwYZAAF_pE0S4g1qx3acdEDloF_CNTh3_Nj3YCY9DwLT-2ZcPqAwaa9vnpw3Kzr1t75tegsI3h34BBXF8plgJjnVAB-cBAYxM0cEDbU6" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/btc"></a></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Thank you to each and every one of you reading this. With all the flashy numbers and tech, it can be easy to forget that DeFi begins and ends with the people that make up this community. There would be no value, liquidity, or any other metrics to measure without the time and attention each one of us dedicates to building a brighter future together. Our team’s resolution for 2021 is to keep working with project communities to highlight the awesome work being done in this space with the platform we’ve been given by you. Thanks for reading and have a happy new year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Yield farming allows projects to bootstrap their communities through incentives created by distributing their protocol’s token, essentially killing two birds with one stone. While these farming opportunities are open to all participants, making the most of these opportunities requires a certain amount of capital and expertise. And nowadays, yield farming has practically become a full-time job.</p>



<p>Harvest Finance set out to make life easier for farmers big and small. It allows users to farm as a collective to achieve the best risk-adjusted rate for a given asset. Launched on September 1st, 2020 in the midst of the yield farming craze with the slogan, “Bread for the People”, <a href="https://harvest.finance/">Harvest Finance</a> has gone on to become one of the largest yield aggregators with a vibrant community from all over the world. With farming having become the new norm, using a yield aggregator like Harvest Finance is like using a tractor instead of a manual plow; it’ll take less effort and ultimately be more efficient.</p>



<h2>Farming at Scale with Harvest Finance</h2>



<p>If you’re new to farming, it seems rather simple. Typically, you deposit a token, stablecoin, or liquidity pool token into a farm to earn tokens at a variable APR. You could simply deposit your assets and come back later to harvest your yield, but you’d be missing out. Manually harvesting and compounding your yields to achieve a higher APY means covering all the gas costs involved. For smaller farmers, the gas costs involved in this process can really start to eat into your returns. Not to mention, you’d need to meticulously calculate and track your APY in order to make sure it was even worth your time or the opportunity cost.</p>



<p>When a user deposits assets into Harvest to farm, they receive fTokens (i.e. fUSDC) which represent a yield-bearing version of the asset. fTokens can be redeemed for the underlying asset at any time. Depositors receive 70% of the profits generated from farming via Harvest as well as FARM token rewards. The remaining 30% is sent to a protocol token buyback and profit sharing program, but more on that later. As the first yield aggregator to adopt a performance-based fee structure, Harvest never charged a withdraw fee as others did. I know what you’re thinking: Why would I give up 30% of my profits when I can farm by myself?</p>



<p>Farming as a collective comes with its advantages compared to going it alone. It can be helpful to think of it as “farming at scale” to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency. If you opted to farm with Harvest Finance in the scenario above, your deposit would automatically compound for a higher APY when possible. Best of all, Harvest covers the gas costs associated with executing farming strategies and compounding deposits. The advantages of Harvest’s collective farming and FARM token design don’t end there though.</p>



<h3>FARM token aligns stakeholders of the Harvest Cooperative</h3>



<p>The goal of the Harvest Cooperative is to become the world’s largest farming cooperative making the latest yield farming techniques accessible to anyone, even those who are currently underbanked. In order to achieve this goal, the farmers of the Harvest Cooperative pool together resources to earn profits and create additional utility and value for its community of Harvest stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the heart of the Harvest Cooperative is Harvest’s FARM token which incentivizes participation, governs Harvest Finance, and allows users to benefit from the performance of the platform. At launch, FARM started with an initial supply of 0. Harvest Finance bootstrapped its community completely by offering FARM token rewards to depositors and liquidity providers. Only 690,420 FARM will be minted over 4 years with a current emission rate of 4.4% per week. At the time of writing, roughly 50% of FARM tokens have been minted so far. FARM tokens are distributed as follows: 70% of FARM tokens go to depositors and liquidity pool providers, 10% of tokens are vested over 4 years to the Operational Treasury to pay for additional development and promotion, and finally 20% are vested over 4 years to the Development Team.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/H1p0SHH5s-9KmMUH4gDeF9w8yCqiNUNQzmpZGzpi5t8G4JalzDe6hdhUK9jk8CBhafbgqyrasyWkHZ7mQ4_hdYKZfGA-uXMtyZHe2Ewl-oYfZ2JaJ62axGOef2RMRDKOFxfw0hhl" alt=""/></figure>



<h4>FARM Buybacks and Profit Sharing Pool</h4>



<p>As previously mentioned, 30% of all the profits generated by Harvest are converted to USDC and used to buy FARM tokens off the market. These FARM tokens are then distributed to Harvest Cooperative members with FARM tokens staked in Harvest’s Profit Sharing Pool. FARM buybacks create natural demand for FARM and are fueled purely by how much profit Harvest is able to generate for its users. The idea is that everyone in the Harvest Cooperative from farmers earning token incentives to the initiatives funded by the Operational Treasury benefit when the value of FARM increases further aligning the different Harvest stakeholders.</p>



<h3>Harvest Cooperative is able to steer growth and adoption together</h3>



<p>The Harvest Cooperative is incentivized to make changes that help the platform grow. Unlike an individual farmer, the Harvest Cooperative has a budget of sorts which it can use to collectively pay for things. FARM holders can create and vote on proposals for new strategies, protocol changes, or even initiatives to be funded by the Operational Treasury. This allows the Harvest Cooperative to stay on top of the latest yield farming strategies. Harvest was the first yield aggregator to release a farming strategy for SWRV, UNI, and Idle Finance. The treasury can also be used to incentivize users to participate in more profitable farms for the Cooperative. The Harvest community also makes use of the treasury to fund programs like creativity contests, bounties programs, and prizes for developer challenges which we’ll cover a bit more later on.</p>



<h3>Farming as a collective offers additional forms of risk mitigation</h3>



<p>Not only can pooling resources fund the development of new strategies, it also can be used to make farming <a href="https://farm.chainwiki.dev/en/security">more sustainable through test suites</a>, ongoing <a href="https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest/tree/master/audits">audits</a> and <a href="https://immunefi.com/bounty/harvest/">security bug bounties</a>.</p>



<h4>GRAIN reparations after USDC/USDT vaults exploited</h4>



<p>On October 26, 2020, an attacker was able to use a flash loan to <a href="https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-flashloan-economic-attack-post-mortem-3cf900d65217">steal 12.5% of funds from Harvest&#8217;s USDC and USDT vaults via an exploit</a>, resulting in a shared loss of $33.8M. The Harvest Community <a href="https://snapshot.page/#/farm/proposal/QmYF62qGaqyHAXt88Hmxise6CFaSWxnTmi5VedZ3VX8Zy2">voted to provide reparations to those affected by the exploit</a> in the form of an <a href="https://medium.com/harvest-finance/announcing-the-grain-claims-portal-20dd12c4f631">IOU token known as GRAIN</a>. Those affected were able to<a href="https://claim.harvest.finance/"> claim their share</a> of the $2.48M returned by the attacker as well as GRAIN tokens. Each week 0.5% of the total FARM emissions are sent to reparation pools, GRAIN buyback and FARM/GRAIN liquidity pool, up to the amount lost in the attack. Creating an incentivized FARM/GRAIN pool creates the liquidity necessary to support the buyback program and allows GRAIN holders to receive more FARM rewards for staking their liquidity as well. For those curious, <a href="https://duneanalytics.com/0xBoxer/-grain">this dashboard</a> has some interesting stats regarding the amount of GRAIN claimed. Solo farmers are often forced to accept losses due to attacks, but as you can see collective farming with an on-going revenue stream offers potential ways to remedy situations such as this.</p>



<h2>Harvest Cooperative has a strong sense of identity</h2>



<p>Even though Harvest community members are from all around the world (with a notable presence in the Chinese DeFi community), Harvest Cooperative has a strong identity and incentive structure that is welcoming of all. Harvest has previously affirmed their belief that financial inclusion is important for everyone, especially the unbanked and the underbanked. An understated benefit of farming together is that Harvest Cooperative is able express their values and give back to the community as a collective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the start, Harvest Finance community has had an appreciation for memes as made evident by their Farmer Chad logo. Anyone who keeps up with DeFi on Twitter has probably seen countless memes of Farmer Chad. This is no coincidence; In the spirit of its #BreadForThePeople slogan, Harvest frequently hosts creativity contests where users are rewarded for their creative contributions to Harvest Cooperative. <a href="https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-finance-farm-arts-creativity-contest-round-4-festive-edition-3ba3e5843da2">The most recent Creativity Competition</a>’s theme is “Celebrating the Festive Season”. The cool part about these competitions is that it allows those without the capital necessary to farm to benefit from Harvest Cooperative’s success.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8759" width="512" height="512" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-1568x1568.jpeg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption>Artwork from Harvest community member <a href="https://twitter.com/stulmtuno4273/status/1330292559277682693/photo/3">Sumire</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Developers will also find they are warmly welcomed in the Harvest community. Harvest hosts developer contests and has <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/harvest-finance/harvest/15/100024325">bounty programs</a> to reward developers who want to contribute to the Harvest Finance ecosystem. For those interested, head over to the <a href="https://discord.gg/ayKVET52z6">Harvest Discord</a>’s #dev channel and introduce yourself.</p>



<p>The Harvest Cooperative also expresses their support for the wider community by giving back to programs like Gitcoin Grants which supports future builders. Harvest <a href="https://harvestfinance.medium.com/week-14-updates-building-today-funding-the-builders-of-tomorrow-74c5ea8575f6">announced on December 1, 2020</a> that it would be partnering with Gitcoin to launch a $500k grant matching pool in the latest Gitcoin Grants Round 8.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Partnerships with Harvest Cooperative</h2>



<p>Harvest also likes to drive engagement through community partnerships and collaborations that present unique opportunities for Harvest Cooperative members to earn rewards in the form of tokens, NFTs, and more. For example, Harvest <a href="https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-apy-vision-partnership-be80f577b18?source=collection_home---6------4-----------------------">will be giving away a total of 80 APYCHADPRO NFTs</a> that grants 90 days of access to the PRO edition of liquidity pool tracker APY.vision to Harvest Cooperative members staking in the Uniswap FARM/USDC liquidity pool. Another example being 88mph’s <a href="https://medium.com/88mphapp/88mph-x-harvest-degen-challenge-over-6k-in-prizes-94979f3a5fa9">recently announced</a> 2-week ‘Degen Challenge’ in collaboration with Harvest which encourages participants to build something creative combining 88mph’s fixed-yield pools or floating-rate bonds with Harvest’s vaults. Last but not least, Harvest <a href="https://badgerdao.medium.com/harvest-finance-joins-the-league-of-badger-builders-551031da69a1">collaborated with Bitcoin-focused BadgerDAO</a> to help launch Badger DAO’s Harvest SuperSett vault. Harvest community members <a href="https://twitter.com/BadgerDAO/status/1334921775013109761">were also eligible to receive</a> at least 20 BADGER during the launch of Badger token.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>With yield farming practically being a full-time job, Harvest Finance has quickly become one of the leading yield aggregators in DeFi. It’s effective use of incentive structures aims to create a positive feedback loop that benefits all stakeholders of the Harvest Cooperative, ultimately forming a strong sense of community.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During DeFi’s most innovative and exciting year, a new kind of trading experience has exploded onto the scene. <a href="https://www.hegic.co/">Hegic</a> is an on-chain, non-custodial platform for options trading, launched by the enigmatic Molly Wintermute. The platform has grown significantly in recent months, after its <a href="https://decrypt.co/35038/hegics-molly-wintermute-im-paying-a-high-price-for-the-mainnet-first-approach-to-building">inauspicious start </a>in April. The first iteration suffered from buggy code, which required Wintermute to return almost $50,000 in locked funds to users. Since then, Hegic has been running smoothly, and volume has <a href="https://www.hegic.co/analytics">rapidly grown</a>. It is poised to become one of the key players in the crypto trading ecosystem.</p>



<p>Hegic allows users to buy put and call options on ETH and WBTC. Currently, total options volume for WBTC exceeds that of ETH. For those who are unfamiliar with options trading, calls and puts are essentially bets on the future price of assets. Buying a call means you have the right but not the obligation to purchase an asset at a certain price (the “strike price”) for an agreed-upon length of time. You pay a premium to purchase the option. </p>



<p>Let’s say you buy a call for ETH at $500. The call option expires one month later. If the price of ETH shoots up to $1,000 during this window of time, you can exercise the option for a profit of $500 less the premium cost. Put options work the opposite way. You reserve the right but are not required to sell $ETH at $500 one month later. If ETH plummets to $250 during this time, you can go buy some ETH at market price then turn around and sell it for $500 as agreed. You profit $250 minus the premium you paid. Premium costs depend on the length of the options contract and the “moneyness” of the option (basically, how far the strike price and the actual price deviate at the time of purchase).</p>



<p>Why would anyone want to use options? Well, for starters, it allows you to trade with leverage and still manage your risk. The beauty of options trading is that traders can use them when they are extremely confident or extremely uncertain, as options can be used as a hedging measure in combination with other trades. The price of a crypto-asset can go parabolic rather quickly. Options allow you to capture all of the upside (or downside) with only the cost of the premium. You are also protected from the asset going <em>against</em> your thesis to an astronomical amount. At worst, you choose not to exercise the option and the only money you’re out is the sunk premium cost. One key aspect of Hegic that experienced traders will need to consider is that the premium is priced in ETH. As the price of ETH fluctuates, the value of the premium also changes, which will impact your P&amp;L.</p>



<p>To offer a viable trading experience, Hegic requires a deep well of liquidity from which traders can draw. Without sufficient liquidity, traders will be unable to enjoy the same experience provided by centralized exchanges, and liquidity providers will be exposed to even greater counterparty risk when writing contracts. Hegic aims to accomplish this by incentivizing liquidity providers. LPs are called ‘writers’ in the Hegic ecosystem. Writers share the premiums paid in their pools. Hegic also incentivizes liquidity provision with the native HEGIC token. </p>



<p>Wintermute envisions HEGIC to become a governance token for the protocol at some point in the future, but currently the token is only a requirement for purchasing a staking lot. 888,000 HEGIC buys a staking lot and with it, the right to the protocol’s settlement fees. There is one additional incentive available to writers. By providing liquidity, you are credited with writeBTC or writeETH tokens. These tokens can be staked to earn rHegic token, which is essentially a vested version of HEGIC that can be sold at a hefty discount before the vesting period ends in late 2021.</p>



<p>Hegic&nbsp;is one of the more complicated DeFi protocols on the market today. It involves a lot more levers and cranks than discussed here, including a bonding curve that controls the new supply of Hegic. To learn more about Hegic, you can check out <a href="https://hegic.gitbook.io/start/">Hegic&#8217;s documentation</a>. You can also try it out for yourself; All you need is an Ethereum wallet. The protocol does not require KYC or account verification. Hegic is proving to be a worthy rival for Deribit, although they are likely to grow in unison given the unique advantages that each provide. Hopefully, there will be plenty of opportunities for arbitrage between the two platforms headed into the future.</p>
