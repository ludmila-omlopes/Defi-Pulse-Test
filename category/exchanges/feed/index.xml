										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There’s a new automated market maker (AMM) on the block, and it has the infrastructure to shake things up in DeFi. The protocol’s tech, which allows the decentralized exchange to feast on the liquidity of other exchanges, is uniquely advantageous for liquidity providers (LPs), so now the race is on to see how many users the project can win over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DEX in question? <a href="https://integral.link/deposit"><strong>Integral</strong></a>, a new kind of trading protocol that launched in March 2021 and whose team is positioning it to compete with both <em>decentralized </em>crypto exchanges like Uniswap and <em>centralized </em>crypto exchanges like Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>An AMM to Eat All AMMs?</strong></h2>



<p>To compete with the exchanges of the world, Integral needs a compelling way to match these exchanges’ liquidity. So what’s one protocol to do against the combined activity of all these other bustling entities?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eIf2Og4K3j8nNVFL5nJ8Qrc3yjSNhKclKz4MAbECv8qCK547sIaNWCiMagEqyYCMJ-TOXTIUy8TOnYTvUoZPim0CkNq-4NfTbj1Q4Fy4vNr_74rQREUgKhNZj_Sgici290erSZAr" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Fortunately for Integral the protocol has an interesting answer, a <strong>new AMM style called an Orderbook AMM, or OB-AMM</strong>. What’s special about this style is it allows Integral to “mirror” its competitors’ external liquidity at will, yet with the major advantage of needing just a <em>fraction </em>of that liquidity in the project’s own pools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is because of how the OB-AMM model achieves what’s known as <strong>concentrated liquidity</strong>, i.e. liquidity that’s distributed along a price range, upon which capital can be condensed in particular places. Integral delivers LPs and traders concentrated liquidity by <strong>decoupling </strong><strong><em>capital</em></strong><strong>, the crypto in the OB-AMM’s pools, from </strong><strong><em>depth</em></strong>, as in an orderbook’s depth or the shapes of pools’ price ranges. The project notably offered this advantage weeks ahead of Uniswap V3, which launched in May 2021 and has since helped popularize concentrated liquidity.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RcOO6tBh5Dq_0_A6E-4QRLO50f1VzBRTUnwmqmiI8d8VuGR1Ecy3THlraM8riVlqNcPkYtO7zz6iUIR-ZrgUMG4XFfeArIDzi1ryi_Wp2IE3vE_OhTG6BslLo2Yt5-mtIp6VO0lH" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Accordingly, Integral can match the world’s exchanges by taking <em>their </em>orderbooks and mirroring <em>their </em>depth onto Integral’s own pools. This is why Integral currently enjoys +$11B in implied liquidity and same-level price impact while simultaneously having only ~$111.5M in <a href="https://defipulse.com/integral">total value locked (TVL)</a> at the moment. It can provide 3x the depth of Binance’s orderbook, for example, and it needs way less liquidity to do so. The ensuing efficiency helps keep price impact lower and LP APYs higher for users.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Impermanent Profit (IP) is here to stay</strong></h2>



<p>There are two other foundational elements of Integral that make the AMM innovative: the protocol’s <strong>trade delay</strong> system and its <strong>mean-0 impermanent loss</strong> (IL) system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Integral’s <em>trade delay</em> forces traders to wait 5 minutes + Ethereum’s confirmation time, an implementation that protects LPs from the threat of (IL) caused by arbitrageurs and frontrunners. And <em>mean-0 IL</em> entails Integral LPs having IL profiles that oscillate around 0. At times this IL will even become negative, meaning it becomes more profitable to supply an asset to a pool in contrast to just holding it in your wallet, and over time the IL will converge to 0.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The combination of these systems with Integral’s overall efficiency has led to pronounced occasions of what the project’s team is calling <strong><em>impermanent profit</em></strong><strong> </strong>(IP<strong>)</strong>. Again, if IL means you would’ve been better off holding your assets than LPing them, <em>IP</em> means you ended up better off LPing than you would have by just holding the underlying assets.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tQ3lQMssk8fCt8YGcx0J__JNKosMufKdj9x6GDPoHYzd4DGESJGM7NxD51pGlB2yMDcdIyw0dGVlQc5px-pYVPUt9972rehX2gijQE3JwOswIUfMOguhnwvCUGp8oumyX9VRqwJf" alt=""/></figure>



<p>For instance, LPs of Integral’s ETH-USDT pool saw <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ/status/1396128896542597121">0.5% impermanent profit</a> within the <em>first week</em> of the AMM opening up trading to the public. Of course there are no guarantees for how anything will perform over time, but Integral’s efficiencies mean there’s undoubtedly more such profits where those came from for the project’s LPs going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>ITGR pre-farming continues</strong></h2>



<p>This coming June 7th, Integral’s token genesis event (TGE) will take place for the project’s native ITGR token. </p>



<p>In the meantime, you can already start accruing ITGR rewards by providing liquidity for, or trading through, the AMM’s pools: ETH-WBTC, ETH-DAI, ETH-USDC, ETH-USDT, ETH-LINK, and the project’s newly launched stable pools, <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ/status/1397608962724294658">DAI-USDC, DAI-USDT, and USDC-USDT</a>. With its concentrated liquidity feature, these new pools are designed to deliver the same stablecoin depth and slippage as some of the biggest pools in DeFi, all while leading the industry in stablecoin trading fee levels at 2 bps. </p>



<h2><strong>Keep an eye on Integral</strong></h2>



<p>Integral is all but poised to grow from here, as the protocol’s ability to mirror competitors’s liquidity makes its potential considerable. At the same time the project is still young and has plenty of work on its roadmap, so there’s lots more to track from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can give <a href="https://integral.link/swap">Integral’s trading pools</a> a try for yourself when you next have the chance, and if you’re wanting to learn more about this game-changing decentralized exchange then you can stay up to speed by following Integral on <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ">Twitter</a> or by participating in Integral’s communities on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/GJYCF55Tb6">Discord</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) took over the world in 2021. While some people still can&#8217;t fully grasp their value proposition, they are an obsession for many others. Artists, collectors and investors have found fertile ground in the blockchain space, where they can trade and speculate on the price of intangible assets. And more importantly, do it seamlessly without auctioneers or any other middlemen. This is where <a href="https://defipulse.com/dodo">DODO</a>’s brand new feature allowing users to fractionalize NFTs called <a href="http://dodonft.io/">DODO NFT</a> comes in. With DODO NFTs, everyone is able to participate in the NFTs ecosystem by leveraging DODO’s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dodo-and-proactive-market-making/">Proactive Market Maker</a> (PMM) protocol.</p>



<h2>Why fractionalize NFTs?</h2>



<p>Although the NFTs ecosystem has seen enormous growth and success in the past months, creating a market for NFTs can still be difficult for many creators. Since NFTs are non-divisible by definition, their price discovery process is hard; ask and bid prices on NFTs usually have huge discrepancies and the most wanted items have prohibitive prices for the small investors and collectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way to overcome the hurdle of price discovery is with DODO’s approach to the concept of fractionalizing NFTs, which can give rise to a highly active and efficient secondary market. In DODO’s proposed mechanism, an NFT or a collection of NFTs are placed in a vault contract and then fragmented into sub-units by issuing ERC20 (fungible tokens) that represent the ownership of the vault. With this process, anyone can buy a fraction or share of an NFT, regardless of the amount of capital they can invest.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jZP26I8hJDnvCEPmyR7hOnuwyZa5nKjXtEay_MFp4xIlp8zD45R-TvmDSEQr-pMCPaNCMyabEdaleujeIkk4yeY6mLGgSR2IqNLWmIIKV8wCmJDVeklpjd_cDgfzsAqPiwh3hF3H" alt="The fractionalization process using DODO"/><figcaption>The fractionalization process using DODO</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Owning an NFT collectively can be very appealing. The power of community ownership comes from an alignment of values and vision surpasses the amount of interest and money one individual can have. Fractionalizing an NFT collectible can also be powerful from a distribution point of view since, as more people own an NFT the more it signals the value of it to the community.<br></p>



<h2>Create flexible NFT markets with DODO’s PMM</h2>



<p>With DODO NFT, powered by DODO’s established Proactive Market Maker (PMM), creators can easily fractionalize NFTs and bootstrap a market with interconnected liquidity. DODO NFT’s complete suite of tools allows anyone to handle all the processes related to fragmentation, from the vault creation, the ERC20 tokens issuance, the contracts and the creation of dedicated DODO PMMs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO NFT represents a brand-new solution to pricing and liquidity formation of an NFT marketplace. To begin with, the vault contract can hold various assets, including one or more NFTs or a combination of selected ERC20 tokens, serving as an individual or an organization&#8217;s portfolio. Creators of DODO NFT Vaults can also choose to issue a predetermined amount of fungible tokens and select how many will be assigned to the team and how many will go directly to provide liquidity for the PMM.</p>



<h2>What is different from a traditional AMM pool?</h2>



<p>Suppose you issued a certain amount of tokens for an NFT community sale. Automated market makers that use a constant product approach, such as Uniswap V2, require initial liquidity to be deposited in order to set the initial price of the asset. If you want to create a liquidity market for all tokens, you will need to provide an equal amount of money as the bid-side liquidity to achieve the desired initial price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO proactive markets allow you to provide single-sided liquidity. You can build a DODO NFT market and proactively set the starting price for a fragmented token without committing any capital. As traders buy the fungible tokens, the price will automatically increase following a curve. One other crucial contrast to automated market makers that use a constant product approach is that, in the former, only a single price curve is supported, while in the case of DODO PMM, it allows you to set a Slippage Coefficient (k) that gives the flexibility to handle different markets situations.<br><br>Below we can observe different price curves that can be set up with DODO PMM. The simplest one is when k=0. In this curve, the price doesn&#8217;t change with the amount sold. Any token will always be sold for the same price. In the opposite spectrum, k=1, the price increases with the amount sold in the same behavior as the constant product function. It&#8217;s possible to set more smooth curves choosing intermediary values for k. DODO PMM pools also allow for the customization of the trading fees collected from buyers rather than a fixed 0.3% fee.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dodo-Curves-1024x446.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9228"/><figcaption>NFT PMM price curves with different “Slippage Coefficient” k.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Splitting up the DODO NFT Vault into fungible tokens can lead to a powerful mechanism as it allows composability to many other DeFi protocols. The underlying tokens can then be accessed using different DEXes and trading routes to be exchanged with any other token. They could even possibly be used as collateral for borrowing other assets like say for derivatives trading or even as a part of an NFT index primitive.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Learn more about DODO</h1>



<p>DODO NFT is a novel protocol specially designed for innovation and liquidity. It will be launched in June of this year, giving everyone access to the NFTs market. DODO also has many more solutions to different market strategies. You can learn more by <a href="https://dodoex.io/">exploring DODO</a>, following <a href="https://twitter.com/BreederDodo">DODO on Twitter</a>, and joining in the discussion happening in the DODO community on <a href="https://t.me/dodoex_official">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/sWKnV6fRqm">Discord</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Innovation happens at a head-spinning pace in decentralized finance. As the ecosystem continues to stack up brick after brick, our capabilities reach new heights and knock down old barriers. The protocol I have the pleasure of introducing to you in this week&#8217;s DeFi Pulse Drop has its eyes set on disrupting the existing futures and derivatives market by offering innovations that lower the barrier to entry for even low liquidity futures.</p>



<p><a href="https://perp.fi/">Perpetual Protocol</a> is a decentralized perpetual contract protocol capable of supporting 20x leverage for any asset without being limited by available liquidity thanks to its virtual AMM (vAMM) design.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://perp.fi/"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="179" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_1wIKLnIokys0kmlCyynzTg.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8506" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_1wIKLnIokys0kmlCyynzTg.png 700w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1_1wIKLnIokys0kmlCyynzTg-300x77.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></figure>



<h2>What is a Virtual AMM (vAMM)?</h2>



<p>To get a better understanding of the differences between your average AMM like Uniswap or Curve and Perpetual&#8217;s vAMM, let&#8217;s take a step back. Automated Market Maker (AMM) exchanges you&#8217;ve likely encountered before swap tokens with a constant product function <em>x*y=k</em>. And while there has been a lot of innovation happening around AMMs in the past couple years to optimize swapping assets, Perpetual Protocol&#8217;s virtual AMM (vAMM) is something unique which enables perpetual contracts for any asset with lower slippage by design. </p>



<p>I know what you&#8217;re saying: &#8220;Aren&#8217;t all smart contracts <em>virtual</em>?&#8221; And, you&#8217;re not wrong, so let&#8217;s clear up what this means exactly by examining that function <em>x*y=k</em> from earlier. With most other AMMs, you deposit two assets into reserves represented as <em>x</em> and <em>y.</em> The available quantities of these two assets establishes the price you might pay to swap in either direction. As the supply of <em>x</em> increases, the supply of <em>y</em> decreases and vice versa. The result is that <em>k</em> remains constant and liquidity is always available albeit the price gets higher and higher as you approach the extremes in either direction. Perpetual Protocol&#8217;s vAMM functions similarly except it doesn&#8217;t actually store any tokens inside the AMM itself.</p>



<p>Perpetual Protocol&#8217;s <a href="https://gov.perp.fi/t/deep-dive-into-our-virtual-amm-vamm/38">virtual AMM (vAMM)</a> gets its name from the fact that its doesn&#8217;t store, swap or spot trade any tokens and is only used for price discovery. Assets are instead sent to another smart contract referred to as the &#8220;Clearing House&#8221; which then stores the assets in the &#8220;Vault.&#8221; The Clearing House accepts deposits and records position ownership with the relevant info such as initial margin, level of leverage, and whether it is long or short.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/perpetual-protocol-vammGIF-1.gif" alt="" class="wp-image-8500"/></figure>



<p>This GIF illustrates a user entering a new position; Alice longs 2.439 ETH with 100 DAI as the collateral, subsequently changing the state inside this vAMM. As you can see, the initial state of this vAMM was 40000 vDAI and 100 vETH and now the vAMM&#8217;s state becomes 97.5609756 vETH and 41000 vDAI, but remember that the Vault still holds the 100 DAI Alice deposited. The Vault always has enough collateral to pay back every trader (given the assets are able to be liquidated) because one trader&#8217;s gain will cancel out another trader&#8217;s loss. Alice&#8217;s gains are Bob&#8217;s losses and so on and so on.</p>



<h3>Funding Rate</h3>



<p>In order to ensure vAMM markets follow the wider market, Perpetual Protocol utilizes an hourly funding rate similar to that of FTX Exchange. Each and every hour, funding payments are paid to traders as incentive to take up the unpopular side of the market bringing it back in line with the index price. For example, if the funding rate is positive, long positions pay short position holders,</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="614" height="68" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9830363769d701def459c9d411726a64fae37ffb.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8496" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9830363769d701def459c9d411726a64fae37ffb.png 614w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/9830363769d701def459c9d411726a64fae37ffb-300x33.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 614px) 100vw, 614px" /></figure>



<p>Chainlink oracles are used for the index price because in the words of the Perpetual team, &#8220;it&#8217;s the most battle-tested Oracle solution on the market.&#8221;</p>



<h4>Insurance Fund</h4>



<p>50% of all transaction fees on Perpetual Protocol are deposited into an Insurance Fund, which is used as the first line of defense when the system faces unexpected losses such as losses in the liquidation process and funding payments.</p>



<h2>What makes a vAMM unique?</h2>



<p>Perpetual Protocol&#8217;s vAMM affords it a few key advantages over other AMM designs.</p>



<h3>No liquidity providers = no liquidity restrictions or impermanent losses</h3>



<p>Perpetual Protocol has no cap on the open interest in its markets. <strong>Separating token reserves from price discovery allows Perpetual Protocol to guarantee liquidity for any size trade.</strong> Perpetual Protocol doesn&#8217;t require large liquidity reserves or liquidity providers at all to function due to the fact no funds are stored in the vAMM. As previously mentioned, one trader&#8217;s losses are another&#8217;s gains. Each trade counteracts another and the funding rate creates incentives to keep the market moving in the right direction. <strong>And because there are no liquidity providers, there is no impermanent loss from price fluctuations.</strong></p>



<h3>Adjusting k to manage slippage</h3>



<p>Another major difference with the design of virtual AMMs is Perpetual Protocol&#8217;s ability to adjust <em>k </em>in the equation to respond to market conditions i.e. reducing price slippage for traders. At first, <em>k </em>will be manually set by governance but the ultimate goal is to algorithmically adjust it based on a number of potential factors such as volumes, open interest, funding payments, volatility, etc.</p>



<h2>PERP token</h2>



<p>PERP tokens have three major functions: governance, staking, and acting as the asset of last resort.</p>



<h3>Asset of Last Resort</h3>



<p>PERP acts as the ultimate backstop of the system. In the case where the Insurance Fund is unable to cover unexpected losses, PERP tokens are minted and sold to cover the rest.</p>



<h3>Governance</h3>



<p>The Perpetual Protocol team has laid out a <a href="https://docs.perp.fi/getting-started/governance-plan">governance plan</a> with a timeline for transitioning control of the protocol to an on-chain governance system ran by PERP token stakers. The plan details future updates including on-chain voting with delegation, bug bounty programs, ecosystem grants, and eventually proposals will only be executable code, much like Compound&#8217;s current governance. In the immediate term, you can visit <a href="https://gov.perp.fi/">gov.perp.fi</a> to propose and discuss governance proposals. </p>



<h3>Staking</h3>



<p>PERP holders can stake their tokens for a fixed amount of time known as an &#8220;epoch&#8221; to receive staking rewards in PERP as well as a portion of the transaction fees in stablecoins. At launch, epochs last 7 days but can be adjusted by protocol governance. Although you may stake at anytime during an epoch, staking rewards are time-weighted meaning that staking earlier in the epoch yields a greater portion of rewards. Staked PERP tokens continue to rollover into the next epoch unless unstaked in the present epoch.</p>



<p>50% of Perpetual Protocol fees are awarded to PERP stakers for taking on the risk of being the backstop to the Insurance Fund and properly governing the protocol. At the end of each epoch, stakers can claim their portion of transaction fees paid in stablecoins immediately; however, PERP earned via staking is locked until the first day of the same month in the subsequent year.</p>



<h3>PERP Distribution</h3>



<p>According to Perpetual Protocol&#8217;s distribution <a href="https://docs.perp.fi/getting-started/perp-tokens">overview</a> found in their docs, the initial total supply is distributed as follows:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="371" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/perp-distribution.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8491" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/perp-distribution.png 600w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/perp-distribution-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<ul><li><em>7,500,000 PERP tokens: Balancer LBP.</em></li><li><em>36,000,000 PERP tokens: Team and advisors.</em></li><li><em>6,250,000 PERP tokens: Binance Labs, invested in the development of the Perpetual Protocol approximately 2 years ago.</em></li><li><em>22,500,000 PERP tokens: Strategic investors to the extent they fully exercise their rights to purchase PERP tokens.</em></li><li><em>77,750,000 PERP tokens: Ecosystem and rewards, which will benefit traders, stakers, and developers who participate in the Perpetual Protocol ecosystem. As Perpetual Protocol transits to community governance, the Perpetual Protocol community will make all decisions regarding the distribution of ecosystem rewards.</em></li></ul>



<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that only 10% of the PERP tokens allotted to ecosystem and rewards will be unlocked until the community governs the protocol on-chain. Additionally, protocol governance or an emergency minting of PERP tokens to backstop the system could result in the max supply of 150,000,000 PERP being altered.</p>



<p>The Perpetual Protocol team plans to make 7.5M PERP tokens available on Balancer around Sep 7, 2020 at 6:00 am UTC. This first Balancer pool will be a liquidity bootstrapping pool designed to disincentivize price speculation and front running. Check <a href="https://medium.com/@perpetualprotocol/perp-token-distribution-2f1b6196744d">here</a> for more details and also stay tuned to <a href="https://twitter.com/perpprotocol">Perpetual&#8217;s twitter</a>. There are also plans to have a <a href="https://docs.perp.fi/getting-started/liquidity-mining-proposal">liquidity mining rewards</a> program to further bootstrap the system. </p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s been truly exciting to watch DeFi grow recently. And to me, projects like Perpetual Protocol mark a new level of maturity for decentralized finance. The Perpetual team has put together some interesting new concepts with existing money legos to expand the DeFi ecosystem&#8217;s toolbox. I recommend you check out Perpetual Protocol&#8217;s<a href="https://perp.fi/"> trading interface</a>, dive into their <a href="https://docs.perp.fi/">documentation</a> if you&#8217;d like more information, or even join the discussions happening in their <a href="https://gov.perp.fi/">gov. forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you ask me, the most exciting part of decentralized finance is seeing DeFi&#8217;s money legos stacking up over time. Futureswap, launching Monday afternoon PST (April 20th, 2020), is a great example of how decentralized finance iterates on past successes to evolve into something even better.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0"><img loading="lazy" width="2488" height="1168" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8166" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1.png 2488w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-300x141.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-1024x481.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-768x361.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-1536x721.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-2048x961.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-1568x736.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2488px) 100vw, 2488px" /></a></figure>



<h2>Futureswap is like a blend of Uniswap and BitMEX</h2>



<p><a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0">Futureswap</a> is a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) perpetual futures platform where users can trade any ERC20 token with up to 20x leverage. These perpetual futures have no time limits and can remain open as long as the trader has enough collateral.</p>



<p>Similar to Uniswap, users deposit equal parts of token and stablecoin (i.e. ETH/DAI) and are issued ownership shares of the liquidity pool. With Futureswap, users can enter long or short leveraged future positions which are matched by liquidity pools. </p>



<p>But here&#8217;s where things get interesting:<strong> Futureswap has zero slippage for any size trade and 100% pooled assets can be utilized.</strong> Liquidity providers can earn trade trading fees and borrowing fees on up to 100% of their deposits. And so, Futureswap pools can be very efficient with their use of capital resulting in more stability and potentially high returns for liquidity providers compared to traditional AMM exchanges.</p>



<h3>Dynamic Funding Rate (DFR)</h3>



<p>Futureswap has a unique mechanism called the dynamic funding rate or DFR for short. The DFR is a borrowing fee based on the total trade size designed to maintain the volume balance between open longs and shorts. During times of disproportionate demand, liquidity providers&#8217; pooled assets are used to take up the opposite side of any unmatched trades. So if there were tons of unmatched ETH longs, LPs cover the ETH essentially opening a short.</p>



<p>Long and short volumes are pooled and here&#8217;s the kicker: <strong><strong>the more popular pool</strong> is charged the dynamic funding rate and it&#8217;s paid to the pool in low demand. </strong>The DFR keeps increasing as the disparity grows to disincentivize trades on the popular side. In other words, the longs pay the shorts or vice versa until the sides become balanced. This mechanism limits extreme volatility and properly rewards liquidity providers for their exposure to risk.</p>



<p>So what are the risks for liquidity providers if worse comes to worst and 100% of the traders are short and the price decreases? Liquidity providers essentially have the same exposure as if they were holding 100% of the token instead of 50% token and 50% stablecoin. While it&#8217;s still a risk, the dynamic funding rate lowers the likelihood of such a situation happening.</p>



<h2>Incentives designed to benefit all involved</h2>



<p>On top of trading and borrowing fees, Futureswap has its own token called Futureswap Tokens (FST) which creates incentives that reward the users that contribute the most to the system. </p>



<h3>Futureswap Tokens (FST)</h3>



<p>Futureswap Tokens (FST) are non-transferable tokens given out weekly to traders, liquidity providers, and referrers and are used to govern Futureswap as well as incentivize user participation. </p>



<p><strong>FST tokens are distributed weekly according to your portion of the total trade volume, liquidity provided, and/or referrals. </strong>Essentially, the more you use Futureswap, the more FST you earn over time.</p>



<h3>Trading Fee Discounts</h3>



<p>Traders earn FST based on their total weekly trades proportional to the total trade volume for that week. The higher your % of total trading volume, the higher your weekly FST reward.</p>



<p>Traders who hold FST also receive discounts on their trading fees. These discounts are calculated on a logarithmic curve and can reduce trading fees by up to 30%. The cool part is that you aren&#8217;t required to burn the tokens to receive the discount.</p>



<h3>Earn FST with Referrals</h3>



<p>Futureswap has built-in referral rewards for users who drive trading volume to the platform. Referrer FST earnings are based on closed trade volume of users you refer in proportion to total closed trade volume of users from other referrers. </p>



<p>Anyone can create a referral link for their Ethereum address and start earning fees by simply adding to the Futureswap links ?src=[YOU ADDRESS HERE] parameter.  </p>



<p>For example<a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0x1E042E6a150961E3aC07b7eF0643776A5b6a73ac">,</a> here&#8217;s what our referral link looks like <a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0">https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0</a>. <br><em>We appreciate any use of our referral link as it helps support DeFi Pulse.</em></p>



<h3>Governance proposals</h3>



<p>Futureswap is designed to be fully decentralized and community-run as soon as possible. The distribution of FST rewards the most active users for participating. These FST holders then create and vote on new proposals like adding new trading pairs and changing system parameters. Stakeholders must burn FST to create new proposals.</p>



<h3>Reflections on Futureswap&#8217;s design</h3>



<p>As I dug into Futureswap to write this post, I grew to appreciate its design. From the DFR to the distribution of FST, the Futureswap team has paid a particular attention to detail. </p>



<p>For example, Futureswap trading pairs use Chainlink for their price feed oracles. The system also has built-in protections against front running attacks. New position creation timestamps are checked relative to the Chainlink price update. If the new position is opened within a 3 minute window before the price update, the system bumps the user up to the next price on trade close. </p>



<h2>The early bird gets the worm</h2>



<p>The truth is that being an early adopter comes with its advantages. Futureswap Tokens will be distributed to the platform&#8217;s most active users. Futureswap&#8217;s design utilizes FST to incentivize users to participate when activity is low. </p>



<p>Early Futureswap adopters are more likely to have larger contributions proportional to the system total thus earning more FST. So it stands to reason that you&#8217;ll earn more FST by participating sooner rather than later after the community grows even larger and more active.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past, users had to rely on centralized exchanges to trade their cryptocurrency. But, things have come a long way since then and you have other options. And, nowadays decentralized exchanges provide users with a competitive alternative.</p>
<h3>Not sure what decentralized exchanges are?</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s okay if you&#8217;re unfamilar with what decentralized exchanges are. Here&#8217;s a helpful explainer you can read to learn <a href="/blog/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange/">what a DEX is</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got a grasp of the basics, let&#8217;s move onto a few examples. We&#8217;ve put together a list of some innovative and popular DEXes that people like to use in the Ethereum community.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7455 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></h3>
<h3>Uniswap</h3>
<p>Funded by an Ethereum Foundation grant and launched in November 2018, Uniswap is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges and is known for its wide selection of trading pairs. Uniswap&#8217;s code is open source and it has no investor tokens.</p>
<p>Uniswap&#8217;s smart contract let&#8217;s you swap ETH or ERC-20 tokens on-chain by pooling liquidity. Each swap is charged a 0.03% liquidity fee which is added to the pool incentivizing users to contribute equal parts ETH and ERC-20.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7457 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></h3>
<h3>KyberSwap</h3>
<p>KyberSwap&#8217;s a DEX that allows users to swap tokens, powered by the Kyber Network. Kyber Network, a liquidity protocol which aggregates liquidity reserves, held an ICO for its KNC token in late Q3 2017. Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) tokens have a variety of uses on the Kyber Network.</p>
<p>For example, each swap performed on the Kyber Network require the fees to be paid in KNC which is then burned. Paying your fees in KNC gives you a discount. Otherwise, the smart contract swaps part of your payment for the KNC to pay the fee. KNC&#8217;s also needed to open your own liquidity reserve to earn on the Kyber Network.</p>
<p>KyberSwap recently added the option to place limit order trades. No deposit is required and you receive a 50% discount on the 0.1% fee when you pay in KNC.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7456 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/radarrelaylogo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/radarrelaylogo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/radarrelaylogo.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></h3>
<h3>Radar Relay</h3>
<p>Radar Relay is the most popular 0x protocol relayer. With the 0x trading protocol, users submit signed trade order. Users&#8217; orders are kept in orderbooks off-chain and eventually all trades settle on-chain.</p>
<p>Those who keep orderbooks are called relayers because they relay signed orders off-chain. When the order is taken off the book, the other party signs the pre-signed order transaction. And then, the transaction&#8217;s submitted and the funds transfer from their wallets.</p>
<p>And, one of the best parts is that there are no sign-ups, deposits, and currently no fees. Radar Relay offers an experience more reminiscent of traditional exchanges. There&#8217;s no fees to place limit orders; Only trades that take orders off the books, or taker orders.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7176 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo-150x150.jpg" alt="Dex.Ag" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<h3>DEX.AG</h3>
<p><a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> is a free site that searches over 10 of the most popular DEXes for the best price, saving you time and money. Instead of having to run around to each individual site, DEX.AG scans Uniswap, Kyberswap, Radar Relay, Eth2Dai, and loads more DEXes for the best price for your trade.</p>
<p>Simply, enter the token and quantity of what you&#8217;re looking to buy or sell and DEX.AG finds you the best deal. And if you hit the &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; button, DEX.AG will walk you through completing your trade via MetaMask or your web3 browser wallet.</p>
<p>And best of all, you and your trade are interacting directly with the DEX&#8217;s smart contract. So, there are no additional fees on top of fee of your selected exchange.</p>
<h3>Thanks for reading</h3>
<p>Good luck finding the right decentralized exchange for you. And if you have any questions, we&#8217;re here to help in our Discord.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;re probably familiar with traditional cryptocurrency exchanges like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/daley_e6">Coinbase</a> or <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=QVZBT755">Binance</a>. And, you probably know that these exchanges are run by central authorities which hold your funds in custody while you trade. This puts your money out of your control and at risk of theft.</p>
<p>But did you know that many decentralized exchanges or DEXs allow you to make trades directly from your wallet? In fact, in many cases when you trade on a DEX, the funds never leave your wallet which means you avoid paying withdrawal fees on money that&#8217;s yours to begin with. But how does that work?</p>
<h2>DEXs are smart contracts</h2>
<p>Decentralized exchanges are smart contracts that exist on the blockchain. These smart contracts enable peer-to-peer trading by connecting buyers and sellers. There are several ways that decentralized exchanges can provide liquidity to traders. One popular method is to have users supply the coins, tokens, or liquidity necessary for the smart contract to perform trades on demand. These funds are held in the smart contract.</p>
<p>Another way is to keep an orderbook of proposed trades to be submitted to the blockchain later. Users can either propose a trade and sign a transaction or order saying they are willing to trade a set amount of tokens at a set price. Or, you can take an order off the books by signing the other half of a proposed transaction. When the buyer and seller are matched, the transaction signed by both parties is submitted to the blockchain and the funds are swapped between the two users&#8217; wallet.</p>
<p>In both cases, the funds either never leave your wallet or are securely held in a smart contract instead of some company holding your money. And, user like yourself that provide liquidity to a DEX earn a cut of the fees that would usually go to an exchange.</p>
<h3>Smart contracts are open for anyone to use</h3>
<p>When you think of an exchange or DEX, you&#8217;re probably thinking of a website. And while it is true, you usually use a web interface to interact with DEXs; the smart contract behind the website you use to &#8220;trade on a DEX&#8221; is what actually makes the magic happen.</p>
<p>Think of an interface like a keyboard; your computer doesn&#8217;t care what type of keyboard your using. The only thing that matters is that the keyboard is inputting the correct data. Smart contracts are like your computer in this case. They don&#8217;t care how you interact with them as long as you input the right information into the DEX. And so, this means that you can use any interface you want to trade using these DEX smart contracts.</p>
<h2>Get the best-priced trades with DEX.AG</h2>
<p>If you have the choice to use any interface, why not choose one that is convenient and saves you time and money? That&#8217;s what <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> was built for. In the past, you would have had to run around to each DEX and compare prices, but those days are over. DEX.AG checks 10 different decentralized exchanges to find you the best price so you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>You start by picking whether you&#8217;re trying to buy or sell a token at the top of the screen. Next, select the token and the amount you&#8217;re looking to trade. And then, hit the Find Trades button.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7372" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-1024x588.png" alt="trade on a dex" width="900" height="517" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-1024x588.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-300x172.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-768x441.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-1536x882.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-1568x901.png 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade.png 1635w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The exchange found at the top of the list will be the best trade available on the market for the trading pair and amount you&#8217;ve chosen. Click the &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; button and MetaMask will walk you through submitting your trade to the DEX. However, if you haven&#8217;t previously interacted with the DEX, you&#8217;ll be required to send an approval transaction to the smart contract first.</p>
<p>After hitting submit, your trade will be complete as soon as your transaction is confirmed. Well would you look at that, you&#8217;ve completed your first trade on a DEX in just a few clicks!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A decentralized exchange, or DEX for short, is like a stock exchange run by a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Although both allow you to trade assets, a decentralized exchange trades cryptocurrency only and so does not require a centralized authority to operate. Instead, a decentralized exchange uses a smart contract to enforce the rules, execute trades, and securely handle funds when necessary.</p>
<h4>In order to examine the differences, let&#8217;s break down what a centralized exchange looks like in traditional finance.</h4>
<p>Exchanges are where you buy and sell things. More specifically, financial exchanges are where you trade financial assets and commodities. In traditional finance, these assets are held in custody by a central exchange who takes orders from buyers and sellers for commodities, stock, securities, currencies, and more.</p>

<p>To execute a trade, you submit an order to the exchange who then either puts it onto their orderbooks to be filled later or fills the order with an existing order on the books. When you make an order which gets put in the orderbook, it&#8217;s called a maker order. And when your trade order is filled by taking an existing one off the books, your order is considered a taker order.</p>
<h4>DEXes are exchanges built using smart contracts</h4>
<p>Decentralized exchanges are smart contracts written to perform a similar process as the one described above. They allow users to trade cryptocurrencies like ETH for other coins or tokens simply by interacting with their contracts from their wallet.</p>
<p>When you submit trade orders to a DEX, you&#8217;re submitting a transaction to their smart contract on the blockchain. Some DEXes have orderbooks with maker and taker orders. Whereas, other DEXes have pools or reserves of currencies ready to swaps or trades.</p>
<h4>Using a decentralized exchange reduces your risk of hack or theft</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s a risk to putting your money in someone else&#8217;s hands. This is especially true when it comes to cryptocurrency. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges hold millions of dollars of their customers&#8217; funds and are prime targets for hackers and thieves.</p>
<p>Decentralized exchanges reduce this risk by either letting you keep your funds in your wallet until the order is filled. Or rather, the funds are held in a smart contract secured by the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Try it our yourself! It&#8217;s easy; just use <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> to find the best prices from 10 different DEXes in one click. And then, just punch in your desire trading pair and amount, hit Buy Now, and in seconds you&#8217;ll have made your first trade on a DEX.</p>
