										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Users from around the world should be able to easily access the benefits of decentralized finance. Yet in DeFi’s early days, you could really only be initiated to these benefits by manually figuring things out on your own through trial and error. This has kept accessibility at bay in kind!&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s needed, then, is an advanced DeFi transaction builder made simple &#8211; a system where anyone can readily manage a range of different activities, from yield farming to leveraged positions and debt refinancing, from a single dashboard and regardless of skill level. Stepping up to the plate here is DeFi management solution <a href="https://bit.ly/34TuwmX"><strong>DeFi Saver</strong></a>, which just launched the beginnings of such a system via its new powerful <em>Recipe Creator</em> feature. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://bit.ly/34TuwmX"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KN58a0-eduwIKya0Q6ED80owTuiUvM12iaewWfFkfE_2N0R7JGb-bMNvryr5349sctQAiwoI8SWHrdnTLW1Y2Tt46pMtfiedWHj6fAu7fNXoDbfMd7m1OTCz33Qlgg6J-ZeiZw_I" alt=""/></a></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cooking up all things DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>The <strong>Recipe Creator</strong> is a transaction builder interface for creating and executing <em>recipes</em>. Simply put, recipes are blends of DeFi activities that can involve interactions between multiple DeFi apps and additionally utilize flashloans and token swaps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <strong>flashloan</strong> lets users borrow large amounts of crypto <em>without collateral</em> so long as the debt is paid back within the same transaction but, previously, flashloans were mostly isolated to the domain of DeFi experts. That’s all changing now that <strong>the Recipe Creator is letting anyone easily use these powerful tools</strong> to streamline multiple DeFi actions into single transactions, all through DeFi Saver’s audited, reputable, and user-friendly infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://bit.ly/3vZU0el"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--jdU88PMEzy-iT1u8Sc0mHiW21LsZ_nrQlYzEDltwQqiouuIFmq116rjbRJV8grBBzmQBz3FHzAD2TVZnvVG8bK9bVLg2oxsxo1hJSG2fDiTtrN7xd3hvQgCVxCEGUxugjeUYJY" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>The Recipe Creator itself is currently divided into two main parts: the <a href="https://bit.ly/3vZU0el">Recipe Book</a>, which is composed of pre-made recipes or rather pre-structured DeFi strategies, and the eponymous <a href="https://bit.ly/3g1pL1j">Recipe Creator</a>, which allows builders to <strong>simply drag-and-drop their own recipes together</strong> however they please. </p>



<p>Additionally, the Recipe Creator makes use of natural language processing, so users can just write simple instructions like “Supply 500 DAI to Compound” or sequences of instructions separated by commas to quickly create recipes. Recipes currently support actions across top DeFi apps like <strong>Aave, Compound, Maker, Reflexer, and Uniswap V2</strong>, and the DeFi Saver team plans to integrate new protocols regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ease of these future integrations will come courtesy of DeFi Saver’s recently overhauled smart contract system, which now composes transactions efficiently as mixtures of composable activities rather than one long string of stacked actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result is an <strong>optimized transaction builder</strong> system that lets users conveniently manage a range of staple DeFi activities, like borrowing, lending, creating and managing leveraged positions, and yield farming. And if you&#8217;re creating a collateralized debt position in order to obtain stablecoins or other assets for liquidity farming purposes, note that DeFi Saver also has liquidation protection options in the form of their Automation features.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Simulate recipes before you try them</strong></h2>



<p>DeFi Saver notably released a new <strong>Simulation mode</strong> feature alongside the Recipe Creator. This mode lets you quickly spin up a simulated 100 ETH account and then experiment with executing recipes and more with this simulated ETH in any way you see fit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accordingly, gone are the days where users must use <em>actual ETH</em> on the Ethereum mainnet to first get the hang of DeFi activities. Instead, when activated <strong>Simulation mode forks at the current Ethereum block</strong> so you can freely play around with market conditions, e.g. prices, as they existed upon activation. This gas-less environment is perfect for helping novices and veterans alike practice and strategize their DeFi activities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3vARUuaRvmMdANfwH6iyHoXHxSubL1O_oUOJ6Ig4e5Zc6jHnlyyscW1HY820cEiFWI9vnDSLZwtnNaWk5QUVE5uozCYsRT-X55AYcTi__KCFcrkyHg86im1GkPscSi6lZBR0jf5p" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>If you’re interested in starting a Simulation account on DeFi Saver and taking some recipes for a spin, simply <strong>click on the “Simulation” button on the lower left-hand corner of the DeFi Saver dashboard</strong>. Upon doing so, select whether you want to create a new simulated account with 100 play ETH or to simulate your current account as it exists at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Don’t sleep on the Recipe Creator</strong></h2>



<p>As it currently stands, the Recipe Creator already has the potential to bring in more than a few new DeFi users by making the UX around using DeFi so streamlined and convenient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the DeFi Saver team wants to improve this UX even further with more additions and advancements. For starters, new integrations with DApps like Lido, Liquity, and Yearn are on the slate for the near future as are integrations with promising layer-two (L2) scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync 2.0. The DeFi Saver team is also exploring the automation of recipes, so consider keeping an eye out for that as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are interested in tracking the progress of the Recipe Creator going forward, you can stay up to date on all current happenings by following DeFi Saver on <a href="https://bit.ly/34VQnKF">Twitter</a> or by joining the project’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/XGDJHhZ">Discord</a> community. </p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There’s a new automated market maker (AMM) on the block, and it has the infrastructure to shake things up in DeFi. The protocol’s tech, which allows the decentralized exchange to feast on the liquidity of other exchanges, is uniquely advantageous for liquidity providers (LPs), so now the race is on to see how many users the project can win over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DEX in question? <a href="https://integral.link/deposit"><strong>Integral</strong></a>, a new kind of trading protocol that launched in March 2021 and whose team is positioning it to compete with both <em>decentralized </em>crypto exchanges like Uniswap and <em>centralized </em>crypto exchanges like Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>An AMM to Eat All AMMs?</strong></h2>



<p>To compete with the exchanges of the world, Integral needs a compelling way to match these exchanges’ liquidity. So what’s one protocol to do against the combined activity of all these other bustling entities?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eIf2Og4K3j8nNVFL5nJ8Qrc3yjSNhKclKz4MAbECv8qCK547sIaNWCiMagEqyYCMJ-TOXTIUy8TOnYTvUoZPim0CkNq-4NfTbj1Q4Fy4vNr_74rQREUgKhNZj_Sgici290erSZAr" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Fortunately for Integral the protocol has an interesting answer, a <strong>new AMM style called an Orderbook AMM, or OB-AMM</strong>. What’s special about this style is it allows Integral to “mirror” its competitors’ external liquidity at will, yet with the major advantage of needing just a <em>fraction </em>of that liquidity in the project’s own pools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is because of how the OB-AMM model achieves what’s known as <strong>concentrated liquidity</strong>, i.e. liquidity that’s distributed along a price range, upon which capital can be condensed in particular places. Integral delivers LPs and traders concentrated liquidity by <strong>decoupling </strong><strong><em>capital</em></strong><strong>, the crypto in the OB-AMM’s pools, from </strong><strong><em>depth</em></strong>, as in an orderbook’s depth or the shapes of pools’ price ranges. The project notably offered this advantage weeks ahead of Uniswap V3, which launched in May 2021 and has since helped popularize concentrated liquidity.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RcOO6tBh5Dq_0_A6E-4QRLO50f1VzBRTUnwmqmiI8d8VuGR1Ecy3THlraM8riVlqNcPkYtO7zz6iUIR-ZrgUMG4XFfeArIDzi1ryi_Wp2IE3vE_OhTG6BslLo2Yt5-mtIp6VO0lH" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Accordingly, Integral can match the world’s exchanges by taking <em>their </em>orderbooks and mirroring <em>their </em>depth onto Integral’s own pools. This is why Integral currently enjoys +$11B in implied liquidity and same-level price impact while simultaneously having only ~$111.5M in <a href="https://defipulse.com/integral">total value locked (TVL)</a> at the moment. It can provide 3x the depth of Binance’s orderbook, for example, and it needs way less liquidity to do so. The ensuing efficiency helps keep price impact lower and LP APYs higher for users.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Impermanent Profit (IP) is here to stay</strong></h2>



<p>There are two other foundational elements of Integral that make the AMM innovative: the protocol’s <strong>trade delay</strong> system and its <strong>mean-0 impermanent loss</strong> (IL) system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Integral’s <em>trade delay</em> forces traders to wait 5 minutes + Ethereum’s confirmation time, an implementation that protects LPs from the threat of (IL) caused by arbitrageurs and frontrunners. And <em>mean-0 IL</em> entails Integral LPs having IL profiles that oscillate around 0. At times this IL will even become negative, meaning it becomes more profitable to supply an asset to a pool in contrast to just holding it in your wallet, and over time the IL will converge to 0.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The combination of these systems with Integral’s overall efficiency has led to pronounced occasions of what the project’s team is calling <strong><em>impermanent profit</em></strong><strong> </strong>(IP<strong>)</strong>. Again, if IL means you would’ve been better off holding your assets than LPing them, <em>IP</em> means you ended up better off LPing than you would have by just holding the underlying assets.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tQ3lQMssk8fCt8YGcx0J__JNKosMufKdj9x6GDPoHYzd4DGESJGM7NxD51pGlB2yMDcdIyw0dGVlQc5px-pYVPUt9972rehX2gijQE3JwOswIUfMOguhnwvCUGp8oumyX9VRqwJf" alt=""/></figure>



<p>For instance, LPs of Integral’s ETH-USDT pool saw <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ/status/1396128896542597121">0.5% impermanent profit</a> within the <em>first week</em> of the AMM opening up trading to the public. Of course there are no guarantees for how anything will perform over time, but Integral’s efficiencies mean there’s undoubtedly more such profits where those came from for the project’s LPs going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>ITGR pre-farming continues</strong></h2>



<p>This coming June 7th, Integral’s token genesis event (TGE) will take place for the project’s native ITGR token. </p>



<p>In the meantime, you can already start accruing ITGR rewards by providing liquidity for, or trading through, the AMM’s pools: ETH-WBTC, ETH-DAI, ETH-USDC, ETH-USDT, ETH-LINK, and the project’s newly launched stable pools, <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ/status/1397608962724294658">DAI-USDC, DAI-USDT, and USDC-USDT</a>. With its concentrated liquidity feature, these new pools are designed to deliver the same stablecoin depth and slippage as some of the biggest pools in DeFi, all while leading the industry in stablecoin trading fee levels at 2 bps. </p>



<h2><strong>Keep an eye on Integral</strong></h2>



<p>Integral is all but poised to grow from here, as the protocol’s ability to mirror competitors’s liquidity makes its potential considerable. At the same time the project is still young and has plenty of work on its roadmap, so there’s lots more to track from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can give <a href="https://integral.link/swap">Integral’s trading pools</a> a try for yourself when you next have the chance, and if you’re wanting to learn more about this game-changing decentralized exchange then you can stay up to speed by following Integral on <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ">Twitter</a> or by participating in Integral’s communities on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/GJYCF55Tb6">Discord</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Previously, providing liquidity to automated market maker (AMM) projects in DeFi has been a manual and somewhat tedious process. You source the required amount of tokens for your desired pair, approve token contracts, pay gas fees to deposit, and then if you’re looking to farm further yields you might go and stake your new liquidity provider (LP) tokens, which takes yet another transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You go through all these steps only to endure the risk of impermanent loss (IL) while you serve as an LP. Now, though, <em>it is</em> possible to provide liquidity and earn DeFi yields simply and without the risk of IL. That’s because <a href="https://impermax.finance/"><strong>Impermax</strong></a>, a decentralized marketplace for borrowing and lending LP tokens, is offering a game-changing new way to participate in LPing called <em>Indirect Liquidity Providing</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uqVZj40ev81y7CVPscU_0BVsVbfsJJdOBw4VjUjsn0FlIU629FU_0Xnxwji7vd5dEYl2qaZZDIR_l1n-QHD0xv5zWwFbETl4airftBWwWfbQF-iVk3VMoZFQHmnrTNA_r6ThM_Ui" alt=""/></figure>



<h2><strong>A new way to LP in DeFi</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Indirect Liquidity Providing</strong>, a novel way to participate in DeFi liquidity markets, involves earning yield by <em>lending </em>assets to other LP token holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="http://defipulse.com/impermax">Impermax</a> system this works through the protocol’s lending pools, which use LP tokens like ETH-DAI Uniswap V2 LP tokens as collateral. These pools only allow borrowing and lending around a given pool’s token pair, such as ETH and/or DAI if you’re borrowing against ETH-DAI UNI-V2 tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accordingly, DeFi users can now supply a <em>single </em>token to an Impermax lending pool to earn yields indirectly through an AMM, all while facing essentially no threat of impermanent loss. This is in stark contrast to the IL risk users take on when they directly serve as LPs!&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://impermax.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="555" height="329" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2z3yCV7xfTT6sA_rTwCtmQN47qNPcMAicueZTYMiZ9_DZP4SQEghbdR73-3fxZvHPL7D7fsnXJdHC6-v0Kx8kU2EKtvRsAkit5QQp6aO0JtDS4YkjtZBE23z9RhMDhPy2KOzLGHc"></a></p>



<p>In this way, we can understand Impermax as an <strong>Indirect Liquidity market</strong>. Users lend their assets to yield farmers, who then convert these assets into further LP tokens in order to boost their own yields. These yield farmers take on all the risk of impermanent loss while paying out a portion of their yields to pay back their loans from Impermax lenders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Yield farming made simple</strong></h2>



<p>A key advantage of the Indirect Liquidity Providing system is that it offers lenders an easy, simplistic avenue for yield farming. This is because Impermax’s lending markets do away with having to go through multiple steps like acquiring LP tokens and thereafter staking them in order to farm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, <strong>lending through Impermax offers a casual, one-step, staking-like process for yield farming</strong>: you deposit a token into your lending pool of choice, and voila, you’re earning yield and can claim it any time. That’s about as simple as it gets when it comes to farming opportunities in DeFi, so these farms also minimize the need for transactions, which can really add up gas-wise with other traditional yield farms!&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi beginners want entry-level yield farms, and DeFi veterans enjoy simple passive earning opportunities, so Indirect Liquidity Providing has a little something for everyone. This will ensure Impermax will continue to have an important role to play in DeFi, as there’s big demand for simple yield farming solutions while many AMMs are becoming increasingly complex, like Uniswap V3.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Good for DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>To compete with traditional finance, DeFi will need to continue being a liquidity blackhole and continue attracting in more money. More money equals more efficiency, and more efficiency means better options for users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, <strong>Impermax’s Indirect Liquidity Providing innovation represents a benefit for all of DeFi</strong>, insofar as this new lending style makes it easier to provide liquidity to AMMs and can thus help these AMMs grow faster than they would have otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In time, then, we might even see some AMM projects incentivize and promote Impermax’s lending markets since these markets can serve as a direct and increasingly important pipeline of activity to them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Learn more about Impermax</strong></h2>



<p>Impermax is a first-of-its-kind protocol for borrowing and lending LP tokens, so be sure to keep the project on your radar as it now works on adding support for LP tokens from Uniswap V3 and other major DeFi trading protocols like Curve and SushiSwap. You can learn more by following Impermax on <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpermaxFinance">Twitter</a> or by joining in on the project’s community discussions on <a href="https://discord.gg/XN739EgG4X">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ImpermaxFinance">Telegram</a>.</p>

<p>Did you know that the combination of how the Earth’s gravity warps spacetime and the speed at which a satellite travels effectively allows satellites to time travel into the future nanoseconds at time? If you wanted to time travel, theoretically you’d need two things: a massive black hole and and an incredibly fast spacecraft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many have described DeFi as a liquidity black hole, sucking in anything that comes near it. And now, there’s a craft capable of speeds fast enough to <em>slingshot</em> us into the future. <a href="https://app.slingshot.finance/"><strong>Slingshot</strong></a><strong> is a next generation decentralized trading platform which aggregates the top liquidity sources in order to give traders like you the best prices, speed and execution on trades.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In late February, Slingshot launched its closed beta with a unique way for users to earn their invite. The first 100 players to complete the race, a sci-fi themed browser game, won access to the beta and NFT prizes for having the best speedrun times. One player even finished the race so quickly they were <a href="https://twitter.com/AgentProtocol/status/1365828515489345537">accused of being a robot</a>. While a race may seem odd, it was arguably the perfect primer for the futuristic look and feel of Slingshot’s smooth trading interface.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://slingshot.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="443" height="46" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9291" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo.png 443w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo-300x31.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>You can now try it for yourself today because <a href="https://app.slingshot.finance/"><strong>Slingshot</strong></a><strong> is live on Polygon</strong>. Slingshot chose to launch their first Liquidity Zone on Polygon because it fit with their mission to provide traders with the best trading experience.</p>



<h2>Slingshot is tailored for a next level trading experience</h2>



<p>To quote its early <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1329235851813953537">teaser</a> video, Slingshot wants you to “fall in love with DeFi all over again.” And to be honest, the video game-like UI/UX of Slingshot is rather alluring. Between the live price chart, trade history, scrolling price ticker, and all the flashes of red and green when token prices update, you feel like you’re behind the console of a trading machine.</p>



<p>Speedrunning was indeed an apt way to introduce users to Slingshot, a trading platform built for speed. The flow of trading on Slingshot is rather intuitive. You can either start by searching for a token to trade using the search bar or click the + sign on the left side to bookmark a token. Next, select whether you want to buy or sell and the amount you want to spend. And voila, Slingshot finds you the best price for your trade aggregated from the top liquidity sources.</p>

<h3>A polished UI with a buttery smooth trade flow</h3>



<p>When trading bookmarked tokens, this entire process flows smoothly from left to right allowing you to trade incredibly fast, especially on Polygon. While Polygon is the only publicly available Liquidity Zone today, beta users can tell you how awesome it is to seamlessly switch between Liquidity Zones. Slingshot allows you to search for tokens across Liquidity Zones and then filters the list of available tokens according to the Liquidity Zone of the token you selected. So say you’re connected to Ethereum but want to buy MATIC on Polygon. There’s no need to pre-switch your network in Metamask because Slingshot handles this as part of the trade flow. Don’t worry though; you’ll get the chance to see what this is like soon enough.</p>



<p>The more subtle details in the user interface also really add polish to the entire trading experience. For example, when you hover your mouse over the ticker at the top, it feels as if time slows as the scrolling ticker slows in reaction to your cursor. And when you hover over the chart, the cursor becomes a crosshair which follows the line of the price chart. Every little bit adds up to make trading frictionless and fun again.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Being a liquidity provider in DeFi has typically been associated with opportunity costs and risks, particularly the always dreaded risk of impermanent loss. As a liquidity provider, it is important to familiarize yourself with the concept of impermanent loss and determining when the risk to reward ratio is right. But the truth is you have options aside from accepting impermanent loss as an inevitability, you could explore what’s possible with <a href="https://impermax.finance/">Impermax</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Impermax set out to build what they refer to as the “missing piece of the AMM puzzle,” a protocol which allows users to maximize their AMM liquidity pool (LP) tokens. With Impermax, anyone can create a lending market for Uniswap (and soon to be other) AMM LP pairs. Liquidity providers can utilize their LP tokens as collateral to borrow tokens or leverage/multiply their AMM LP positions. Impermax allows users to put LP tokens to work which were once idle leading to more complex strategies and potentially ecosystem growth spurred by increased productivity.</p>



<h2>Maximize the productivity of your AMM LP tokens</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><a href="https://impermax.finance/"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/impermax-blog-thumb-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9190" width="300" height="300"/></a></figure></div>



<p>As previously mentioned, Impermax is <a href="https://impermax.finance/a-lending-market-designed-for-the-lp-tokens-of-uniswap-and-other-amms/">a lending market designed for liquidity pool tokens</a> of Uniswap and other AMMs. Let’s examine how this works behind the scenes. As a borrower, you must first deposit your LP tokens to use as collateral before being able to borrow or leverage. Impermax takes the LP tokens provided as collateral and allows users to borrow the underlying tokens in the LP pair. Interestingly, lenders can choose to lend one or both of the tokens in a LP pair to earn interest without any exposure to impermanent loss. Impermax refers to this as lndirect Liquidity Providing because lenders are basically earning a percentage of the trading fees that borrowers earn but without any impermanent loss.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that lending pools are isolated to each LP token pair and loans are 100% backed by the tokens inside the LP token pair held as collateral. The Time-Weighted Average Price or TWAP provided by Uniswap is used to calculate the liquidation prices of loans to ensure loans remain 100% collateralized. This is kind of cool because it enables Impermax users to permissionlessly add new Uniswap LP tokens and start a lending market for any LP token pair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Borrowers can choose to borrow either token in the pair individually for a unique strategy or simply borrow both to obtain leverage for their desired LP position. Impermax provides an easy to use interface which simplifies the process of leveraging LP tokens up to 10x to a single transaction. Impermax has a liquidity mining program which rewards users with <a href="https://impermax.medium.com/impermax-tokenomics-34cb3dd66474">IMX tokens</a> for borrowing select token pairs. Since your rewards are based off of borrowing, you can actually multiply your liquidity mining rewards by leveraging select token pairs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/borrowable-collateral-infographic.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9191" width="340" height="312"/></figure></div>



<h2>Use caution when operating power tools</h2>



<p>As with all things in DeFi, nothing is without risk. We’ll be discussing some here but as always we encourage you to do your own research. Luckily, Impermax has a very nice <a href="https://app.impermax.finance/risks">risks section </a>to aid you in your due diligence. Like most lending markets in DeFi, it’s possible that you may temporarily be unable to withdraw tokens as a lender if the lending pool has insufficient liquidity like in the event of a “bank run.” Although it should be noted that the dynamic interest rates are designed to alleviate these issues eventually. And of course, if you borrow or leverage, you face the potential risk of liquidation if you don’t meet collateral requirements.</p>



<p>You should also be aware that the permissionless nature of Impermax lending pools is a double-edged sword that carries unique risks. Since anyone can add a new AMM LP token pair and create a lending market, anyone can add new pairs even if they have low liquidity or are potentially malicious. Luckily, these risks are isolated to individual AMM LP token pairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, Impermax relies on Time Weighted Average Prices from the AMM. This means that if a pair is inactive for a long period of time, the price of the oracle may differ substantially from the market price. Additionally, an inactive pair may not attract enough liquidators to insure loans are liquidated in time which can result in a possible loss for lenders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>You can never quite tell which direction the DeFi community will run with an idea but the writing is on the wall that liquidity providers want more out of their LP tokens. Impermax has designed their product to cater to the needs of these liquidity providers in a permissionless way similar to the AMMs themselves. This is enabled by Impermax’s practical and prudent decision to isolate risk to individual lending pools. Builders don’t have to ask for permission to whitelist their project’s AMM LP pair and can even permissionlessly incorporate Impermax lending pools at a protocol level.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a borrower looking to leverage your LP tokens or a lender looking to earn some extra yield from indirect liquidity proving, you should explore <a href="https://impermax.finance/">Impermax</a> available lending pools today. If you’re unsure or just want to take a test drive, you can test Impermax’s application at no cost on Ropsten testnet with zero risks.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The origin of the Sanskrit word <em>guru</em> is said to be based on the syllables<em> gu</em> (गु) and <em>ru</em> (रु), which stand for darkness and &#8220;light that dispels it.&#8221; Gurus cast out the darkness of ignorance with the light of their wisdom. To become a guru, you must be able to take in your surroundings to gain perspective and glean greater wisdom. DexGuru wants to be your guide lighting the way through the dark forest. <a href="https://dex.guru/">DexGuru</a> harmonizes permissionless, real-time data and analytics of every on-chain market in a single UI capable of trading across DEXes.</p>



<h2>Trade with more awareness with real-time on-chain market data</h2>



<p>It’s 2021. Traders like you need more than a simple From / To interface when it comes to determining how and when to execute your strategy. <a href="https://dex.guru/">DexGuru</a> offers a better way to monitor on-chain markets for any token on Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Pancakeswap. Traders using DexGuru have permissionless access to data in real-time including charting, liquidity, pool activity, trading volume, and trading history. So what does permissionless access mean to you? It means you can copy and paste any token address into DexGuru’s search bar and tap into loads of information generated from analysis of on-chain trading activity for free.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://dex.guru/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9147" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1536x864.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1568x882.png 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>We might be biased towards the color purple here but&#8230; DexGuru is rather sleek looking, combining various data feeds into a responsive and appealing UI/UX. View charts and trading data in real-time for any token as trades occur to stay more informed with what’s happening on-chain. Want to know more about the token you’re viewing? Simply click the DYOR button at the top of the page and get a rundown of that token’s basic info and community links. Beyond price and trade history, traders and farmers alike can utilize real-time liquidity data to monitor when liquidity is added or removed from pools. Not to mention, DexGuru can give you insights into the behaviors of other traders in the market, but we’ll get to that later.</p>



<h3>Become one with the flow &#8211; executing trades on multiple chains from one UI</h3>



<p>Under the hood, DexGuru uses the 0x API to provide users with gas-efficient order routing. Connect your wallet and select your network to buy and sell tokens on EVM-compatible chains. There is no more waiting for token listings because DexGuru permissionlessly indexes each token market. In other words, when it is added to the DEX, it’s added to DexGuru. </p>



<p>Trade orders are routed through any 0x API connected exchange including Uniswap, Kyber, Curve, Balancer, CREAM, Bancor, mStable, Shell, Swerve, SnowSwap, SushiSwap, DODO, Mooniswap(1inch protocol AMM), PancakeSwap, BakerySwap, Mooniswap, DODO_V2, SushiSwap, Nerve Finance, Belt Finance, and Ellipsis.</p>



<h2>Gain more insight with DexGuru’s real-time on-chain analytics</h2>



<p>One of the most interesting features DexGuru has to offer is the deeper analysis it performs on user trading history. DexGuru is constantly monitoring on-chain markets for new trades. When a new trade is received, DexGuru analyzes the trader’s address and marks it with a special emoji in the pool activity or trading history.</p>

Most likely a bot.</p>



<p>These sorts of analytics in the heat of the moment can help you as a trader reassess the situation. It’s a refreshing dose of signal among the noise when you need it. It’s nice to know when you’re swimming with the whales or interacting with a bot. Put simply, DexGuru’s real-time insights aim to give traders an edge. And what’s not to like about emojis?</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>Since its initial public beta release on February 17th, many more exciting developments have been brewing for DexGuru. DexGuru aims to add all major EVM-compatible L1 and L2 networks with significant on-chain activity before the end of the year. To that end, DexGuru <a href="https://blog.dex.guru/seed">has raised $1M in a private seed round </a>to continue building its Web3 trading platform. So keep your eyes out for new DEXes, networks, and features in the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Options trading has become more popular than ever now that anyone can trade from anywhere with a few taps. The barriers to entry have been lowered improving accessibility for the average joe. In case you don’t know, options are financial primitives that give a trader the choice (or the <em>option</em>) to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined strike price at some point in the future. Traders can utilize options to hedge against potential price changes or to speculate on the future price of an asset. As DeFi matures, on-chain financial primitives like options become the building blocks for even more sophisticated financial instruments.</p>



<p>If options trading is what floats your boat, say ahoy to SIREN, a decentralized protocol aiming to carve out a unique market niche by catering specifically to sophisticated users interested in holding and actively trading tokenized options contracts. This nautical-themed on-chain options marketplace launched its alpha release in December 2020 and is about to embark on the next chapter of its journey. <strong><a href="http://sirenmarkets.com/">SIREN Markets</a> is set to launch on mainnet March 1.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="500" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/siren-1000x500-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8932" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/siren-1000x500-1.jpg 1000w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/siren-1000x500-1-300x150.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/siren-1000x500-1-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<h2>SIREN Markets offer seamless on-chain options trading</h2>



<p>SIREN is a decentralized protocol which facilitates a marketplace of fully-collateralized, on-chain options. SIREN protocol tokenizes both the long and short sides of an options contract as ERC20 tokens which enables options to be traded via its AMM design requiring no third-party settling mechanism or order matching to complete option settlement on chain. Siren AMM v2 can trade up to 6 SIREN options contracts which all share collateral and payment assets in a single pool. This enables liquidity to be rolled over when a market expires for a seamless UX for liquidity providers.</p>



<p>It starts with liquidity providers depositing collateral into the SIREN AMM pool. So for the WBTC/USDC calls the collateral asset would be WBTC. When you as a trader go to buy options from the AMM, the collateral held within the pool is used to mint a pair of tokens: bToken and wToken. bToken, which stands for buyToken, is sent to the buyer and gives the holder the right to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined strike price. While wToken, short for writeToken, stays in the pool. If the option is left unexercised, wTokens allow the holder to withdraw the collateral or withdraw the exercise payment from the contract after expiration.</p>



<p>Note, that SIREN AMM v2 only trades bTokens, but not wTokens. Although, the Siren team has stated that trading of wTokens may become available in the future. Users pay a premium to the pool in the collateral asset each time they make a trade. This process results in liquidity providers passively becoming covered option writers, automatically underwriting contracts to meet demand from traders. In addition to collecting premiums, liquidity providers benefit from any slippage in AMM trades and earn SI token rewards from the SIREN <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/expanding-the-siren-lpp-c69969e25d41">Liquidity Provider Program (LPP)</a>. It’s always worth noting <a href="https://docs.sirenmarkets.com/faq/what-is-a-liquidity-provider#risks">the risks associated with providing liquidity</a>.</p>



<h3>Giving sophisticated options traders the right tools for the job</h3>



<p>The tools that options traders have come to rely on in traditional finance were refined over decades and decades. So it only makes sense that these early days of DeFi provide ample opportunity to incorporate and innovate on these tools. SIREN’s design allows traders to easily swap options in and out in order to build complex positions as well as the necessary information to assess those positions.</p>



<h4><strong>SIREN AMM v2 pricing is time-decay-aware</strong></h4>



<p>There are two factors that determine the price of each trade on SIREN v2: spot price and slippage. The spot price is determined using a Black-Scholes model, which takes into account parameters like the underlying price, time to expiration, option strike and implied volatility, coupled with a Chainlink price oracle. Utilizing this formula allows Siren Markets to be time-decay-aware requiring no arbitrage in order to quote reasonable prices. Similar to other AMMs, trades will be impacted by slippage based on the size of the trade and available assets in the pool. In other words, the larger the trade relative to the size of the pool, the higher the slippage. This slippage ultimately benefits liquidity providers as another source of returns for liquidity providers on top of collecting option premiums.</p>



<h4><strong>What is ITM, ATM and OTM?</strong></h4>



<p>These expressions are likely familiar to options traders so we’ll skim through these rather quickly. For more in-depth info, you can refer to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp">Investopedia’s definitions</a>. An ITM (short for ‘in the money’) option which has value because it has a favorable strike price compared to the current market price. As you can probably guess, an OTM (short for ‘out of the money’) option still needs to reach its strike price whereas an ATM (short for ‘at the money’) has reached the strike price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These terms help determine what kind of options traders buy or sell taking into account how that option might behave in the current market. For example, an ITM call may require a smaller rise in the cryptocurrency price to be profitable, but there is less potential upside compared to an ATM or OTM call. So if you believe the market price is going to rise significantly, you might consider buying an OTM call because you’d have a greater potential upside while limiting exposure to loss if the price fell.</p>



<p>These are just a couple examples of the ways traders can make use of different option characteristics to influence their trading strategy. Greeks are another way options traders can assess an option.</p>



<h4><strong>Meet the Greeks</strong></h4>



<p>As Siren is meant for experienced options traders, we’re only going to give a brief overview of <a href="https://docs.sirenmarkets.com/faq/what-are-the-greeks">how option Greeks apply to Siren Markets</a>. To get caught up to speed, you can learn more about these general concepts <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/trading/getting-to-know-the-greeks/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Delta</strong></p>



<p>Delta measures a ratio comparing the difference between the underlying asset price relative to the strike price of the option. The delta of a long call is positive; the delta of a long put is negative. The delta is reversed for short calls and puts. Delta is only a theoretical approximation of your exposure in the underlying asset.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Gamma</strong></p>



<p>If you imagine delta as the &#8220;speed&#8221; of your option position, gamma is the &#8220;acceleration.” The gamma of long options, calls or puts, is always positive; of short options, always negative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more gamma your position has, your position delta can change a great deal and probably needs close monitoring. Gamma is highest for the ATM strike, and slopes off toward the ITM and OTM strikes.</p>



<p>If you think the price of an underlying asset is about to change quickly, you want to buy an option with relatively high gamma. For example, the higher the gamma, the more delta if the underlying asset price moves the way you want it to, and vice versa.</p>



<p><strong>Theta</strong></p>



<p>As touched on before, Theta measures the rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time sometimes referred to as time decay. No one can escape time, not even options. Time decay describes how long calls and puts have negative theta, losing money as time goes on. Short calls and puts are the opposite having positive theta and making money as time passes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Theta is highest for the ATM strike, and slopes off to the ITM and OTM options, and responds to the passage of time and changes in volatility the same way that gamma does. The theta of options is indirectly proportional to gamma. When gamma is big and positive, theta tends to be big and negative. That&#8217;s the trade-off. A position that has a lot of gamma (good for fast changing underlying assets) also has lots of theta that is continuously eroding its value.</p>



<p><strong>Vega</strong></p>



<p>Vega is how much the value of an option changes when the implied volatility of that option changes. Long calls and puts both have positive vega and profit when implied volatility rises. Inversely, short calls and puts both have negative vega and profit when implied volatility falls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more time there is until expiration, the higher the vega is for an option. Vega also depends on where the price of the underlying asset is relative to the strike price of the option. Like gamma and theta, vega is highest for the ATM options, and drops for the OTM and ITM options. So, ATM options with lots of time to expiration are the most sensitive to changes in implied volatility.</p>



<h2>SIREN Governance</h2>



<p>The SIREN Market project was created to bring the features and tools options traders are familiar with from traditional finance to a seamless on-chain experience without sacrificing autonomy. The Siren team understands that a platform built to cater to sophisticated users only benefits from their feedback and collaboration. And so, SIREN’s native token SI is designed to reward early users placing the future of the platform in their hands via protocol governance. Liquidity providers, traders, and market makers will receive SI token rewards in exchange for their participation. By design, the most experienced and knowledgeable users will be given the most influence over the platform to help respond to future market demands.</p>



<p>The SI community will be able to create new option markets and determine the fee rate for writing, closing, and redeeming an option. These fees accrue to SI token holders; although it should be noted that upon launch these fees will be set to 0 to reduce the friction for users looking to explore SIREN Markets.</p>



<p>The first SIREN Liquidity Provider Program (LPP) began in December 2020 and was <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/expanding-the-siren-lpp-c69969e25d41">extended through May 2021</a>. Find out more about SIREN’s SI token and liquidity providing program <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/si-token-distribution-event-cff0be106fc6">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Roadmap</h2>



<p>Looking toward the future, <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/si-token-distribution-event-cff0be106fc6">SIREN’S roadmap</a> details many future upgrades to the platform like expanding the list of available asset pools. SIREN is considering adding SUSHI/USDC, UNI/USDC, YFI/USDC, LINK/USDC pools starting with Sushi. Even further out, SIREN protocol will be modified to allow yield-generating assets to be used as collateral.</p>



<p>Other improvements which option traders may want to keep their eye out for include future interfaces for constructing option spreads and effecting basket trades natively. SIREN also plans to explore layer 2 solutions to improve efficiency and lower fees for its users.</p>



<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>



<p>DeFi is disruptive because it gives everyone access to the same tools and data as the experts. Many users who had never had never previously owned a share in a company or a treasury bond are now active participants in a new financial paradigm. With the increasing popularity of options trading in traditional finance, it stands to reason that on-chain options may play a bigger role as DeFi reaches more widespread adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It boils down to: Do you desire a more sophisticated options trading experience? If so, SIREN would like to invite you to join them in building a platform that suits your needs. This is an opportunity to influence the platform early in its development. <strong><a href="http://sirenmarkets.com/">SIREN Markets</a> is set to go live on mainnet on March 1, 2021. </strong>If you want to know more, we recommend joining SIREN’S <a href="https://t.me/sirenmarkets">Telegram</a> or following them on <a href="https://twitter.com/sirenprotocol">Twitter</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The average person would describe cryptocurrency as highly volatile. And while this is true for many, there are coins designed to reduce volatility or stability commonly referred to as stablecoins. Stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the US Dollar, have dramatically risen in popularity thanks to the utility they provide to users and smart contracts alike. Users tend to gravitate to the narrative of USD pegged stablecoins as a familiar unit of account. However, history has shown that stablecoins pegged to the value of a specific asset or basket of assets don’t always hold their peg. And when they do go off peg, it can quickly diminish the reputation of a stablecoin built on the premise of always being $1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Limiting a stablecoin to always equaling $1 also limits the mechanisms available to a community to bring the stablecoin back on peg. This can lead to added complexity like introducing new collateral types and subsequently undesired risk in lieu of what many would argue is the simpler mechanism: negative interest rates. In the end, many stablecoins resort to centralized custodians to hold USD in a bank somewhere or governance systems that require lots of participation to maintain relative stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflexer’s RAI returns crypto to its roots drawing inspiration from the early days of stablecoins to offer crypto-native stability. RAI is an ETH backed, non pegged stable asset known as a reflex index whose monetary policy is managed by an on-chain, autonomous controller. <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5626157429&amp;iu=/22134506417">Reflexer</a> launched on mainnet on Feb 17, 2021.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5626157429&amp;iu=/22134506417"><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="562" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reflexer_banner_youtube2__1_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8909" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reflexer_banner_youtube2__1_.png 1000w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reflexer_banner_youtube2__1_-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reflexer_banner_youtube2__1_-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></figure>



<h3>RAI allows you to trustlessly leverage your ETH</h3>



<p>For reasons we’ll cover in the next section, the function of RAI may be familiar to those with an understanding of MakerDAO’s DAI. DeFi users can borrow RAI via Reflexer by depositing ETH as collateral into what’s called a Safe. Borrowed RAI is subject to an interest rate referred to as the borrow rate. Safes must maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 145%. If a Safe position fails to maintain this collateral ratio, the Safe will incur a liquidation penalty and the protocol will sell collateral to keepers at a discounted rate to cover the debt. Note: there’s also a minimum amount of RAI that must be generated by a Safe. This ensures that in the event of liquidation the Safe has enough collateral to cover its debt and the necessary gas costs and incentives for keepers necessary to liquidate the position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RAI boils down to this: a volatility-reduced representation of ETH. It’s designed to float similar to other currencies and not be pegged to anything. Reflexer relies on a set of protocol parameters including borrowing power and market price to determine the price RAI can be redeemed for (more on this in a bit). RAI was launched with a starting redemption price of $3.14. From this point on, RAI will continue to float while it is managed by the protocol’s on-chain controller. Actually, there’s a chance it never returns to its original redemption price at all. Market forces and Reflexer protocol user incentives influence where the redemption price of RAI floats to. At the time of writing, there are 766 active safes and 24,755,216 RAI in total. You can view the current market price, redemption price, and borrow rate along with other RAI stats <a href="https://stats.reflexer.finance/">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Inspired by the original Dai Purple Paper</h2>



<p>Some of you may recall that the original concept of the DAI stablecoin system outlined in the “Dai Purple Paper” back in February 2018 included negative interest rates. In fact, DAI wasn’t always meant to equal $1 at all. DAI was meant to have a redemption price that would float, producing low volatility but driven by the market.</p>



<p>Reflexer’s RAI aims to fill this void by borrowing many of the concepts from the Dai Purple Paper. Reflex indexes like RAI are designed to reduce volatility, shielding users against major and sudden moves in the market like the<a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-status-report-black-thursday/"> events witnessed on Black Thursday</a>. On a technical level, <a href="https://docs.reflexer.finance/">the system behind RAI</a> is a modified fork of multi-collateral DAI with a few distinct changes. Some of these changes include autonomous feedback mechanisms that control user incentives, simplified variable names, more flexible collateral auctions, long term bounded&nbsp; governance, optional Safe insurance and more. While DAI may have strayed from its early vision leaving its hypothesis untested, Reflexer’s mainnet demo Proto RAI illustrated how an asset can create stability without a peg, relying solely on market forces and redemption price float.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Proto RAI (PRAI) demo ran for nearly 3 months before being shut down on January 25, 2021. More than $612K worth of ETH was deposited into the demo to mint almost 52K PRAI; PRAI’s redemption price started at $2.015 and then floated between $1.937 and $2.06. During this same time period, ETH increased by 350% going from about $400 to $1400. Doing the math, this means PRAI’s redemption price fluctuated less than 4%, demonstrating how Reflexer’s reflex indexes can be a more stable representation of its collateral.</p>



<h2>How exactly do reflex indexes create stability without pegs?</h2>



<p>The money god wills it so. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f5ff.png" alt="🗿" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Or at least that’s the meme the Reflexer community has adopted to refer to the set of on-chain, autonomous controllers that control RAI’s monetary policy. At this point, I think it helps to reiterate that RAI is not a pegged stablecoin, because its redemption price floats. But to fully understand what this means we need to define a few terms key pertaining to reflex indexes:</p>



<p><strong>Redemption price</strong><br>Redemption price is the price that the protocol wants RAI to have on the secondary market (e.g on Uniswap or Sushiswap). The redemption price is used by Safe users to mint RAI against ETH and it is also used during Global Settlement in order to allow both Safe and RAI users to redeem collateral from the system. The redemption price almost always floats and it does not target any specific peg. <em>[insert Pennywise meme of your choice here]</em></p>



<p><strong>Market price</strong><br>This one&#8217;s a little self-explanatory. This is the price that RAI is traded at on the secondary market.</p>



<p><strong>Redemption rate</strong><br>This is the rate at which RAI is being devalued or revalued. The process of devaluing/revaluing RAI consists in the redemption rate changing the redemption price.</p>



<p><strong>Global settlement</strong><br>Settlement refers to the process of shutting down a reflex index and allowing both Safe and RAI users to redeem collateral from the system. Settlement uses the redemption price (not the market price) to calculate how much collateral can be redeemed by each user.</p>



<p><strong>Borrowing power</strong><br>Borrowing power is how many reflex indexes like RAI can be borrowed against one unit of collateral. Each time the system receives a price feed update for its accepted collateral types, the feed data is divided by the redemption price and then divided again by the liquidation ratio in order to calculate the borrowing power. So for example, if ETH’s price is 100 USD, the liquidation ratio is 145%, and the current index redemption price is 1 USD, the borrowing power for ETH is approximately equal to 100 / 1 / 1.45 = 68.96 USD.</p>



<h3>Let’s dive into a few examples to see what RAI looks like in practice:</h3>



<p>When the market price of RAI is greater than the redemption price for a sustained period of time, the redemption rate becomes negative. A negative redemption rate lowers the redemption price. This results in users’ borrowing power being increased as RAI becomes cheaper inside the protocol. The redemption price continues to lower until the market price reaches it. In other words, this process creates a strong incentive for users to sell their RAI or even leverage their collateral to generate more sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>Now, imagine this process in reverse. When the market price of RAI falls below the redemption price for a long enough period of time, the redemption rate becomes positive. This in turn lowers users’ borrowing power which then causes more users to buy RAI to pay down debt or buy it with the expectation that the market price will follow the redemption price. Likewise, this process continues until the difference between the market and redemption price is reduced to 0.</p>



<p>There are a few interesting caveats to Reflexer worth noting including the fact that the system’s desired steady state may not reduce the redemption rate to 0%. There may be a non-zero redemption rate where the redemption price and market price remain relatively close to one another. Additionally, the system can collect stability fees even when the redemption rate is negative. When a reflex index is being repriced because of the redemption rate, the amount of stability fees collected (denominated in the reflex index) doesn’t change.</p>



<h2>Reflexer’s Ungovernance</h2>



<p>If you haven’t picked up on it yet, Reflexer protocol highly prioritizes trustlessness and in pursuit of that end: governance minimization. Reflexer has laid out a multi-stage process at the end of which governance will not control or be able to upgrade most core contracts and many Reflexer protocol parameters will be set autonomously by other external contracts. Before this process could begin, the following conditions would need to be met first:</p>



<ul><li>Governance must not add or plan to add any more collateral types</li><li>All infrastructure for governance minimization must have been audited and tested in production</li><li>Finally, the system must accrue enough surplus in its main treasury so that it can afford to pay for oracle, PID, state management etc costs for at least 6 months.</li></ul>



<p>The list of components to which can be minimized and automated to varying degrees is far too long for us to cover here, but please refer to <a href="https://docs.reflexer.finance/ungovernance/governance-minimization-guide">Reflexer’s Governance Minimization Guide</a> to learn more. A key takeaway is that the first of 3 Governance Minimization Levels is expected to be reached within 14 months after launch (approx. April 2022).</p>



<p><strong>What does this mean for the average user?</strong> The behavior of RAI and other reflex indexes will be more predictable with defined parameters. Furthermore, developers looking to incorporate reflex indexes into their protocol or smart contract will be able to trust that its behavior won’t change undesirably.</p>



<h2>Interesting possibilities enabled by reflex indexes</h2>



<p>Reflexer’s redemption rate mechanism when put in the hands of DeFi developers could be utilized in all sorts of ways. A prime example being a unique money market design that takes advantage of RAI’s changing redemption rate to offer users better interest rates or speculate on the expected market price of RAI in the future. When viewed as an intrinsic interest rate for RAI, you can start to see how the redemption rate can be incorporated into a whole range of products and services from options to portfolio management strategies. Yield aggregators in particular would benefit from unfiltered access to borrowing power allowing them to remove deposit caps or simply be more capital efficient. RAI’s low volatility also lends itself well to being used as collateral for synthetic asset tokens.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>Reflexer offers crypto-native stability while taking an approach previously left unexplored by the DeFi ecosystem. RAI answers the call for an ETH-backed asset with low volatility which many DeFi users have been calling for since the transition away from single-collateral DAI. Beyond individual users, Reflexer’s goal towards “ungoverned,” unfiltered access to borrowing power could prove to be a useful resource to future DeFi protocols. You could say these are uncharted waters in what might be a blue ocean.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DeFi is a fast moving and highly competitive space. While DeFi may level the playing field by allowing anyone to participate, it still comes with risks and has a steep learning curve. When these factors are combined, it’s easy to see how the average user may feel left behind at times. Built by the team at Bloq, <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5620418823&amp;iu=/22134506417">Vesper Finance</a> attempts to lower the barrier to entry for users by striking a balance between professionalism and DeFi’s dynamism in its products. Vesper’s first product — Vesper Grow, originally introduced as “Holding Pools” — offers users an easier way to passively earn a yield with their tokens, though with several innovations including a <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-modularity-48e64c810760">modular</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-multi-pool-3ea7f7325d39">multi-pool</a> design enabling pools to adapt and transition strategies behind the scenes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vesper’s ultimate goal is to create DeFi products with a set-and-forget type experience that adhere to Vesper’s stated <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vespers-core-principles-491c169778e1">Core Principles</a>: longevity, quality, trust, and community. Vesper’s roadmap is guided by these principles, featuring an economic model crafted to align Vesper stakeholders via VSP token incentives and community-created pools (More below.) <strong>Vesper emerges from beta on </strong><a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vesper-launch-date-february-17-2021-c08245cd3f18"><strong>February 17, 2021</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5620418823&amp;iu=/22134506417"><img loading="lazy" width="604" height="179" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ONoLln5Q.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8888" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ONoLln5Q.png 604w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ONoLln5Q-300x89.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></a></figure>



<h2>Vesper Grow &#8211; adaptable pools with more than meets the eye</h2>



<p>In a nutshell, you deposit a token into a Vesper Grow pool, the pool then automatically puts your tokens to work in other DeFi protocols earning a passive return in the deposited token based on your chosen asset and risk tolerance. Vesper pools are scored and placed into two risk categories: <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/the-vesper-view-defining-conservative-vs-aggressive-ac5d44950384">Conservative and Aggressive Pools</a>. Risk scoring assesses the complexity of a pool’s underlying strategy, security of the protocols it interacts with, and the collateral ratios among other technical factors.</p>



<p>At first glance, Vesper may appear similar to other vault-like products, but upon further examination there is more than meets the eye. From a user’s perspective, a Vesper Grow pool represents a “front pool” that all tokens are deposited into. However, pool strategies can deploy tokens to any number of “back pool” strategies. We’ll cover more on how this multi-pool design makes Vesper’s products more adaptable in a bit.</p>



<p>Farmers will be happy to hear Vesper definitely learned a thing or two from last year’s yield farming craze. Vesper Grow cuts down the number of steps involved in traditional yield farming and has also been built with special features catering to farmers. For example, Vesper implemented <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612">EIP-2612</a> across all platform tokens which allows approvals to be made via off-chain signature. This is cheaper and faster, as it doesn’t require a separate transaction solely to approve interactions with these tokens. Another prime example is the sweeperc20 function which allows pools to swap ERC20s accumulated by front or back pools for more of the deposit asset so you won’t miss out on protocol rewards or future airdrops.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What makes Vesper’s approach different?</h2>



<p>When you dive into Vesper, you’ll find there is hidden complexity behind the simple user experience.</p>



<h3>Highly modular, multi-pool design makes Vesper’s products versatile</h3>



<p>Vesper takes the concept of <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/rethinking-money-legos-for-sustainable-yield-strategies-8852d126750d">money legos</a> to heart. As previously mentioned, all Vesper pools have a single “front pool” that is actually made up of modular “back pool” strategies behind the scenes. Each strategy is like a money lego brick which can be swapped in and out without users needing to switch “front” pools. This allows Vesper’s products to be highly adaptable. In other words, Vesper users will never have to deal with pools being abandoned due to outdated strategies or what the Vesper refers to as “strategy fade,” establishing a set-and-forget user experience. Not to mention, this makes it easier for developers to utilize Vesper pools by seamlessly transitioning strategies without requiring smart contract upgrades and constant maintenance for integrations.</p>



<p>Vesper’s multi-pool design also enables earning strategies to be gradually upgraded over time. For example, a pool can start at 100% of an older strategy and keep slowly increasing its exposure to a newer strategy 5% at a time. This upgrade mechanism can be used to limit exposure to riskier strategies eliminating the need to cap deposits or ignore a strategy. Or, it can even allow the community to test out future “beta” pools proposed by community developers. It also enables a “market basket” of strategies, as there is no limit to concurrent strategies via this multi-pool design.</p>



<h3>Structured approach to code audits, testing and deployment</h3>



<p>“Aping” into smart contracts on a whim isn’t for everyone for a reason. Writing a complex smart contract system is hard. Getting it right on the first try is even harder. Users, especially inexperienced users, can all too often get burned by a mistake or bug found in complex smart contracts that “test in prod.”</p>



<p>Vesper takes a structured approach to testing and deploying new code. Vesper Finance has high standards for technical review. New code is audited several times, and potentially re-audited, throughout the formal software development process. Each new strategy or protocol integration Vesper deploys goes through a series of tests and safety checks. New code is run through off-mainnet tests, private mainnet tests, and then a public beta before ever reaching production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vesper users have the freedom to set their own pace. <a href="https://app.vesperdev.net/">DeFi power users can opt-in to experimental pools via app.vesperdev.net if they wish to try out new strategies early.</a> Meanwhile, the average user can be confident that any new pool or strategy available in production (<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5620418823&amp;iu=/22134506417">app.vesper.finance</a>) has been through formal testing and auditing, whether it was developed by the Vesper team or a community member. (More on that below.) This process is not only about safety but it’s also about building trust with Vesper users and the wider DeFi community.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Vesper strives to foster community and drive long-term adoption</h2>



<p>Having a strong community is vital for any DeFi project to thrive. Community is fostered through trust and forming sustainable relationships. Vesper’s stated <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vespers-core-principles-491c169778e1">core principles</a><strong> </strong>are longevity, quality, trust, and community. By design, Vesper inherently vets for quality in its testing and deployment processes. Thorough testing combined with the set-and-forget user experience is likely to garner the trust of many DeFi users. This foundation of trust will be vital when moving forward on Vesper’s timeline towards community-created pools.</p>



<h3>Community-created Pools with Vesper Labs</h3>



<p>Vesper eventually plans to release Vesper Labs, allowing anyone to propose new strategies and pools. Developers whose strategies are adopted by the Vesper community are entitled to 5% of the fees generated for life — the same 5% that the Vesper team would get for pools <em>they</em> create. This generates a strong incentive for community developers to craft more and more innovative strategies. Vesper Labs improves accessibility by opening the door for anyone with talent and a clever strategy to contribute. And when paired with Vesper’s modular design, users enjoy a seamless experience while still benefiting from improved strategies.</p>



<h3>Vesper token incentives designed for sustainability and offer a clear path to decentralization</h3>



<p>The Vesper system has been designed from the start to create a sustainable economic model that ties the products in the Vesper Finance ecosystem together. VSP incentives aim to bootstrap the Vesper community by converting participants into protocol stakeholders. The system also encourages volunteer developers, cutting them in on revenue in a way that puts them on equal footing relative to the Vesper founders. This is key to <a href="https://docs.vesper.finance/community-participation-and-governance/governance">Vesper’s plan towards becoming fully decentralized</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8875" width="768" height="432" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1536x864.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-2048x1152.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1568x882.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<p>As you can see, 95% of the fees generated by Vesper products are sent to the Treasury Box and swapped for VSP, creating natural demand for VSP based on the returns Vesper pools are able to generate for its users. These VSP tokens purchased by the Treasury Box are then distributed to those with VSP staked in the vVSP governance pool. The other 5% of fees goes to the developer who authored the strategy — either a member of the Vesper team or a member of the Vesper community. This revenue model keeps participants engaged and helps ensure the ecosystem’s longevity, funding such activities as engineering, marketing, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At launch, users can earn VSP tokens one of three ways: participating in Vesper’s pools, staking in the vVSP governance pool, and providing liquidity for particular VSP trading pairs. (See more about the <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vespers-tokenomics-an-overview-f342ae5b613f">tokenomics, distribution, and emission schedules</a>.)</p>



<h2>Coming soon: Vesper Earn’s “Directed Pools”</h2>



<p>I couldn’t tell you all about Vesper without mentioning this future feature. While Vesper Grow allows users to deposit “Token A” and get more of “Token A,” Vesper Earn pools (previously discussed as “Directed Pools” at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paTBo4atcAo">BitGive De-Phi conference</a>) will allow users to deposit “Token A” and earn “Token B.”&nbsp; If you’ve been in DeFi long enough, you’ve probably fantasized about taking part of your stack, setting a strategy and turning on the auto-pilot. Vesper aspires to fulfill this dream for DeFi users. <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-vesper-earn-and-programmable-yield-afb2db24974a">Vesper Earn</a> pools take the yield they generate from user deposits and delivers what they call “programmable yield.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, you could set up a directed pool where your yield is used to purchase other tokens, passively diversifying your portfolio. You could even conceivably make a directed pool that splits your yield into other Vesper pools. There are so many different ways you could utilize directed pools. Imagine a pool that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKPm9PH4gXI#t=17m53s">donates its yield to charity</a>. All sorts of initiatives could use directed pools to bootstrap their funding. Or perhaps you like to treat yourself, you could create an income pool that sends you some stablecoin spending money each day. It will be really exciting to see these pools in action.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>It’s easy to take for granted the progress DeFi has made over the past year alone. However, Vesper has clearly been taking notes. From the methodical testing procedure to the attention paid to mitigating “strategy fade” via its <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-modularity-48e64c810760">modular</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-multi-pool-3ea7f7325d39">multi-pool</a> design, Vesper has demonstrated their dedication to crafting a product model that addresses the concerns of its users and forming a sustainable community built on trust. Vesper seeks to foster a global community including support for eight different languages: English, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Russian, and Turkish. It will certainly be exciting to follow Vesper as it proceeds along its roadmap towards Community-created and Earn Pools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recent events have made it all too clear to the average user why decentralization has a key role to play in having a fair and efficient market. Futureswap aims to disrupt the multi-billion dollar perpetual futures trading market currently dominated by centralized services. Futureswap takes a different approach with a hybrid between Uniswap and a perpetual futures exchange platform governed by the community. You may remember Futureswap from their <a href="https://medium.com/futureswap/futureswap-lessons-learned-from-a-3-day-alpha-be4e37bc8c52">successful Alpha in April 2020 which ultimately ended early</a> after DeFi users flocked to the platform in overwhelming numbers. In less than 3 days, Futureswap’s Alpha 24hr trading volume grew to $17M and liquidity passed $1M. Erring on the side of caution, the Futureswap team decided to end the Alpha earlier than initially planned.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Now they’re back with something even better, the Futureswap V2 Beta is </strong><a href="https://futureswap.com/"><strong>already launched on mainnet</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The Futureswap V2 Beta includes upgrades like live pricing and higher capital efficiency which aim to provide a perpetual futures trading experience that outperforms <em>centralized</em> exchanges.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="494" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-1024x494.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8860" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-1024x494.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-300x145.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-768x370.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-1536x741.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-2048x988.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-1568x756.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>What makes Futureswap V2 Beta special?</h2>



<p>Futureswap is a decentralized exchange platform with an automatic market maker (AMM) design that enables traders to enter leveraged perpetual futures with low slippage. Its automatic market maker (AMM) design provides higher capital efficiency offering up to 10x leverage. According to Futureswap: after $50m in liquidity, Futureswap should have better price execution for a $1m trade than any other decentralized exchange and after $300m it has the lowest slippage compared to centralized exchanges based on the current slippage parameters. </p>



<p>Additionally, Futureswap pools can be very efficient with their use of capital resulting in more stability and potentially high returns for liquidity providers compared to traditional AMM exchanges. Futureswap utilizes what’s called a Dynamic Funding Rate or DFR for short. The DFR is a borrowing fee based on the total trade size designed to maintain the volume balance between open longs and shorts. During times of disproportionate demand, liquidity providers’ pooled assets are used to take up the opposite side of any unmatched trades. So if there were tons of unmatched ETH longs, LPs cover the ETH essentially opening a short.</p>



<p>Long and short volumes are pooled and then the more popular pool is charged the dynamic funding rate and it’s paid to the pool in low demand.<strong> </strong>This mechanism limits extreme volatility and properly rewards liquidity providers for their exposure to risk. The DFR keeps increasing as the disparity grows to disincentivize trades on the popular side. In other words, the longs pay the shorts or vice versa until the sides become balanced. This also means that liquidity providers have the potential to earn more thanks to the DFR.</p>



<h3>Oracle Relayer Network (ORN)</h3>



<p>One of the biggest improvements Futureswap V2 brings is the new Oracle Relayer Network (ORN) which enables instant pricing and real-time trading. ORN has been described as a mesh between a price oracle and a meta-transaction processor node. Futureswap users are able to trade in real-time by signing a message including their order and submitting them to ORN. Then, ORN verifies the signed message and finalizes the trade on-chain at the current price. Transactions will fail if outside accurate price bounds set by ORN to protect users. The Futureswap team is taking further steps to improve the Oracle Relayer Network’s security with audits by <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a> and plans to add more nodes to the network.</p>



<h2><br><strong>How Futureswap works</strong></h2>



<h3>Traders</h3>



<p>As we’ve covered, <a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/">traders on Futureswap can open long or short perpetual future positions with up to 10x leverage</a> in real-time with instant pricing. Perpetual futures on Futureswap have no time limits and can remain open as long as the trader has enough collateral. Traders will either pay or earn the dynamic funding rate when opening longs or shorts depending on whether they are on the popular side of the trade or not. Traders also earn FST token rewards each epoch based on their percentage of close trade volume that distribution period.<br></p>



<h3>Liquidity providers</h3>



<p>Liquidity Providers<a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/pool"> add liquidity to Futureswap pools</a> in equal parts to earn trading fees and FST token rewards. For example, if you wanted to add liquidity to Futureswap’s ETH/USDC pool, you would need $100 worth of ETH and 100 USDC. Once deposited, LP tokens are minted representing your share of the pool. These LP tokens can be redeemed at any time if their liquidity is not in a trade. Liquidity providers earn trading fees for allowing traders to use their liquidity. Liquidity providers also earn FST token rewards as an incentive to further grow Futureswap’s available liquidity.</p>



<h3>Liquidators</h3>



<p>Liquidators monitor the platform for positions that are close to violating margin requirements and send liquidation transactions to close at-risk positions for a liquidator fee. It’s vital to the health and stability of the platform for positions to be reliably closed once they reach their liquidation price. It’s worth mentioning that submitting these transactions does not require the liquidator to provide any value or to take over the trade. They simply close the trade on behalf of the protocol and are rewarded for doing so. Currently, the percentage that liquidators receive is 30% of the remaining collateral up to a maximum (currently set to 500 USDC).</p>



<h2>Futureswap is governed by the community</h2>



<p>FST is Futureswap’s non-transferable governance token which is<a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/rewards"> rewarded to traders, liquidity providers, and referrers each day.</a>&nbsp; FST allows the Futureswap community to propose and vote on changes to the protocol, enabling it to evolve and improve over time. We’ve already mentioned FST tokens a few times covering Futureswap’s various incentives designed to incentivize user participation. <a href="https://medium.com/futureswap/futureswap-governance-token-distribution-d2712c855da5">FST is used to reward the Futureswap</a> users contributing to the growth and adoption of the platform. And since Futureswap is governed by the community, this gives the most active users influence over the future of the platform. In other words, users who participate sooner rather than later after the community grows even larger are more likely to have a larger impact with their contributions and receive more FST rewards.</p>



<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>



<p>Potentially disrupting such a big market like perpetual futures presents an opportunity for Futureswap. Futureswap is designed with the expectations of serious trades in mind. Futureswap’s design with its high capital efficiency and low slippage lends itself well to larger trades for whales and industry traders. Its instant pricing and real-time trading ORN system provides a better trading experience with built-in protections against front running attacks. Futureswap may also continue to provide even lower slippage as liquidity grows over time. FST rewards increase the likelihood of this occurring by incentivizing adoption.</p>



<p>Try <a href="https://www.futureswap.com/">Futureswap</a> today and start earning FST rewards. Also, be sure to check out the Futureswap community on <a href="https://twitter.com/futureswapx">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/ZCcxtu9VxH">Discord</a>.</p>
