										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The internet has evolved over time to become a vital part of our daily lives. Web3 marks the next evolution of the internet where websites, applications, or services are controlled by their users. When you see the phrase &#8220;Web3 compatible&#8221; this often means that the website or service interacts with the Ethereum network. If you&#8217;re new to all this, it&#8217;s certainly a bit confusing. So, to better understand it&#8217;s easier if we take a look back at how we got here.</p>
<p>In the early days of the internet, websites had limited functionality. Users mainly consumed content from websites. Maybe you had a personal web page but it was static. And, it was hosted by your ISP or a site like GeoCities. There was little interactivity except for maybe a guestbook where users could leave their name and a brief comment.</p>
<h3>Web 2.0: The rise of social media</h3>
<p>Next came Web 2.0 as some would call it. This era saw a notable shift towards user participation. Social media sites like MySpace, Facebook, YouTube, etc. became the norm. Before long, the majority of content was being generated by the users of a website. However, these users don&#8217;t control the content they create. Websites host their content for them. And so, users are expected to abide by their terms of service (ToS) or they&#8217;ll get the boot. Not to mention, the website can change their ToS at anytime forcing the user to agree or be cut off from the service and, in some circumstances, their own data.</p>
<figure id="attachment_7628" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7628" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7628 size-medium" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Decentralization_diagram.svg_-300x266.png" alt="" width="300" height="266" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Decentralization_diagram.svg_-300x266.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Decentralization_diagram.svg_-1024x908.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Decentralization_diagram.svg_-768x681.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Decentralization_diagram.svg_.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-7628" class="wp-caption-text">A is a centralized network. B is a decentralized network.</figcaption></figure>
<h3>Web3: Giving the power back to the people</h3>
<p>Web 2.0 relies on users to create the value which the owner or host can reap the benefits from. In most cases, you have little to no control over your data. Also, you never know if the content you enjoy will stick around. When content is no longer needed or threatens profits, the host of the website or service has the right to remove it from their platform leaving you high and dry. Not to mention, most service providers own your data under their terms of service. Web3 seeks to empower users and to recapture the value that they create.</p>
<p>Web3 applications, sometimes referred to as <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-dapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApps</a>, are built on decentralized peer-to-peer networks like <a href="https://concourseopen.com/blog/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>. Instead of being run by some company, these networks are built, operated, and maintained by their users. They&#8217;re self-organizing and lack a central point of failure. Additionally, they&#8217;re open-source meaning anyone&#8217;s help to build upon this shared infrastructure. Products and services that are &#8220;web3 compatible&#8221; have the ability to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Smart contracts are like pieces of code that run on the Ethereum blockchain. Once launched, they operate as programmed and users can rely on them to be unstoppable and censorship-resistant. Web3 is the future of the internet that treats it like the shared infrastructure it is. It&#8217;s a future where everyone can contribute value to the internet and be rewarded for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized application (DApp) commonly refers to an application built on top of the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.</p>
<p>The exact definition of DApp can be hard to pin down because things change so quickly. But, the term DApp can be loosely defined by the qualities that decentralized applications share.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7603 aligncenter" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DFP-DApp-img-1-300x208.png" alt="" width="475" height="330" /></h2>
<h2>Decentralized applications come in many different flavors</h2>
<p>DApps come in many shapes and sizes, but they all have a few things in common. For example, most DApps are open source. Smart contracts serve as the code behind decentralized applications running on the Ethereum blockchain. Meaning DApp users aren&#8217;t required to sign up or create a login, but instead interact with the application directly on the blockchain. Also, this means that decentralized applications are often unstoppable, uncensorable, and users&#8217; data and interactions are permanent.</p>
<p>In some cases, decentralized applications interact with the world outside of the Ethereum blockchain. These DApps require information provided by an <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-an-oracle-how-smart-contracts-see-the-world/">oracle</a> to operate. For example, <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MakerDAO</a> currently relies on price feeds from several exchanges to determine the price of DAI or when to liquidate <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-cdp/">CDP</a>s.</p>
<p>Some DApps have their own peer-to-peer networks built on top of Ethereum which enhance or extend the functions of their underlying smart contracts. For example, <a href="https://0x.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0x</a> protocol&#8217;s network of relayers instantly relay trade orders which are later settled on-chain. While others, use other peer-to-peer networks like <a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPFS</a> to host content or even their frontend interface.</p>
<h4>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the fastest growing category of DApp.</h4>
<p>While not every DApp involves money, most of them do. And by far, the most popular DApps provide finance products or services on the Ethereum blockchain. Just to name a few types of DApps in DeFi: <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/earn-income/">lending</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange/">DEXes</a>, tokenized assets, payment solutions, insurance, etc. Learn more about <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi/">DeFi</a> and the most <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-on-ethereum/">popular DeFi applications</a>.</p>
<h3>DApps and their users make smart contracts bigger than the sum of their parts</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, not every DApp falls into the DeFi category. For example, DApps can be games like trading cards and collectibles with ownership stored on the blockchain. Other DApps form social networks using Ethereum accounts as logins and decentralized storage like IPFS to host user generated content.</p>
<p>Another common form of DApp is a DAO or decentralized autonomous organization. DAOs are like companies or organizations without a leader. They can govern the way smart contracts or DeFi protocols operate. Some DAOs even tokenize ownership and share profits like a company.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve only skimmed the surface of what many might consider a DApp. But like we said, the world of decentralized applications is changing everyday. Each new project or innovation adds to the ecosystem and affects what can be defined as a DApp.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smart contracts exist on the blockchain and can only access data available on-chain. They rely on what&#8217;s called an oracle to interact with real world, or off-chain, data. An oracle is a source of data that is being fed to a smart contract. For example, oracles provide data like the price of a stock, weather data like temperatures, or even the outcome of a sporting event.</p>
<h3>Oracles are divided into two categories: software and hardware.</h3>
<p>Software oracles relay information to smart contracts from the digital world outside the Ethereum blockchain. This information comes from online sources like websites, backend APIs, or even other smart contracts. Weather data, stock prices, flight schedules, sporting event results, etc are all common examples of information software oracles can provide.</p>
<p>Hardware oracles use equipment to inform smart contracts what&#8217;s happening in the physical world. Hardware oracles often utilize Internet of things, or IoT, devices. These devices track and verify real world data before sending it to the smart contract. Common examples include thermometers, supply chain RFID tags, GPS data, etc.</p>
<h3>Oracles have their ups and downs</h3>
<p>While oracles enable new possibilities for smart contracts, they also introduce potential risks. Smart contracts trust the information given to them by oracles. And, this data is often critical to how the smart contract functions. What would happen if an attacker hijacking the data feed? Or, what if the source of information simply malfunctions? Consequently, Developers have to take these risks into consideration when designing oracles. Decentralizing oracles across multiple sources of data helps mitigate some of these risks.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DeFi is an abbreviation of the phrase <strong>decentralized finance</strong> which generally refers to the digital assets and financial smart contracts, protocols, and decentralized applications (DApps) built on Ethereum. In simpler terms, it&#8217;s financial software built on the blockchain that can be pieced together like Money Legos.</p>
<p>To get a feel for the products and services that exist in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, you can check out our <a href="https://defipulse.com/">DeFi rankings</a> which tracks the current value locked into popular DeFi smart contracts.</p>
<p>Computers have disrupted nearly every industry over the years. Each innovation builds on the previous one, and digital products and services become more sophisticated. Through technology, we&#8217;ve catered the world to fit our needs. From digital assistants to home automation, programs now affect many aspects of your daily life. So why would money be any different?</p>
<h2>What is decentralized finance and who is it for?</h2>
<p>To better understand DeFi, we should first take a look at how traditional finance came about. Although it sometimes feels like money has always been around, that&#8217;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>Humans originally bartered for the goods and services. But as human societies formed and developed, so did our economies. We invented currency to make exchanging things of value easier. Subsequently, currency helped usher in new innovations and higher levels of economic productivity. However, progress didn&#8217;t come without its cost.</p>
<p>Historically, central authorities such as governments have issued the currencies that underpin our economies. Central banks and institutions were expected to carefully manage and regulate the supply of currency in circulation. As the size and complexity of our economies grew, these central authorities gained more power as more people placed trust in them.</p>
<p>You trust your government to not print more money overnight. You trust your bank to safely store your money. And, when it comes to investing, you trust your assets to a financial adviser. By handing control of your money over to others, you hope to earn a profit. But the sad truth about our current financial system is that the power that comes along with this trust isn&#8217;t always rewarded.</p>
<p>We often have very little say in how corporations handle our investments, or even how our governments manage the economy. And in most cases, investors only receive a fraction of the returns generated from the risks taken by these central authorities.</p>
<h4>DeFi is trying to build something different</h4>
<p>Decentralized finance aims to create a financial system that&#8217;s open to everyone and minimizes one&#8217;s need to trust and rely on central authorities. Technologies like the internet, cryptography, and blockchain give us the tools to collectively build and control a financial system without the need for central authorities.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a saying in the blockchain space: &#8220;Don&#8217;t trust, verify.&#8221; Because with a blockchain network, you as an individual can verify any and every transaction that occurs on the blockchain.</p>
<h3>DeFi allows everyone to take charge of their financial well-being</h3>
<p>Almost all DeFi applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain, the world&#8217;s most popular programmable blockchain. Ethereum is a blockchain network that maintains a shared ledger of digital value. Instead of a central authority, the participants that comprise the network control the issuance of ether (ETH), the network’s native cryptocurrency, in a decentralized manner.</p>
<p>Developers can program applications on Ethereum that can create, store, and manage digital assets, also called tokens, on the blockchain. These are called <strong>smart contracts </strong>or <strong>decentralized applications (DApps)</strong>. They’re contracts or agreements enforced by the Ethereum blockchain. Or rather, applications or scripts that run only as programmed on the Ethereum network. You can build complex irreversible agreements without the need for a middle man.</p>
<p>Decentralized finance has the opportunity to bring about a more resilient and transparent financial system. Anyone with an internet connection is able to access and interact with smart contracts built on the Ethereum blockchain. Many smart contracts are built to be open-source and interoperable with existing smart contracts. So, users can verify the smart contracts&#8217; code and choose which services work best for them.</p>
<h4>What are some examples of popular DeFi applications?</h4>
<p>There are <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-on-ethereum/">many different DeFi products and services</a>, some of which you may find familiar to existing financial services but with a decentralized twist.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most popular and fasting growing sector of DeFi is borrowing and lending platforms. Similar to a bank, users deposit money and earn interest from other users borrowing their assets. However, in this case the assets are digital and smart contracts connect the lenders to borrowers, enforce the terms of the loans, and distribute the interest. And it all happens without the need to trust one another or middleman bank. And, by cutting out the middleman, lenders can <a href="https://www.defipulse.com/income">earn higher returns</a> and more clearly understand the risks thanks to the transparency blockchain provides.</p>
<p>Tokens called stablecoins are also important to the DeFi ecosystem. You may be under the impression that all cryptocurrency is volatile. However, stablecoins are tokens designed to hold a specific value and are typically pegged to fiat currency like the US dollar. For example, DAI is a stablecoin pegged to USD and backed by ether (ETH). For every DAI, there is $1.50 of ETH locked into the <a href="http://makerdao.com/">MakerDAO</a> smart contract as collateral.</p>
<p>Another type of popular DeFi application is what&#8217;s called a <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange/">decentralized exchange</a>, or DEX for short. DEXes are cryptocurrency exchanges that use smart contracts to enforce the trading rules, execute trades, and securely handle funds when necessary. When you <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-to-trade-on-a-dex/">trade on a DEX</a>, there is no exchange operator, no sign-ups, no identity verification, or withdrawal fees.</p>
<h3>DeFi is like smart money Legos</h3>
<p>With Legos, you start out with a bunch of small bricks. It&#8217;s up to you how you piece together the Lego bricks to build something new. The same is true about smart contracts. With each new project, product, or service launched on Ethereum, you have one more money Lego in your collection. And by piecing together existing components of DeFi, you can combine, modify, or create powerful new finance tools out of these money legos.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-cdai/">cDAI</a> is a perfect example of money Legos in action. <a href="http://compound.finance/">Compound</a> is a money market or, in other words, a lending service on Ethereum. When you supply DAI to Compound, you receive cDAI tokens which represent both your DAI in Compound and any interest you&#8217;ve earned from lending. Since cDAI is a token, you can send, receive, or even use cDAI in other smart contracts. Money Legos in action: ETH into MakerDAO to mint DAI tokens, DAI being supplied to Compound, cDAI tokens can be used in other DApps.</p>
<p>For example, you can <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/best-decentralized-exchanges-dexes/">swap ETH for cDAI on a DEX</a> and instantly start earning interest for just holding cDAI. And because you choose how you interact with smart contracts on the blockchain, you can use a <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/why-dex-ag/">DEX aggregator</a> like <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> to compare and trade at the best prices across all the popular DEXes, all within seconds.</p>
<h3>*Decentralization may vary</h3>
<p>There are varying degrees of decentralization when it comes to DeFi services. Because the truth is, not everything can be or needs to be fully decentralized.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, stablecoins are popular in DeFi. But, not all stablecoins are as decentralized as DAI. Many of them are actually tokens representing fiat currency deposits. For example, for every USDC token, there is 1 USD being held in a bank somewhere. You can theoretically &#8220;tokenize&#8221; or create a token to represent any real world asset. This is where things become a little less black and white, because while you can trade, send, and receive these tokens on the blockchain, you cannot completely eliminate the need to physically manage or redeem the real world asset.</p>
<p>Take for example, purchasing a home on the blockchain. Say someone tokenizes the deed to their home, places it on a decentralized exchange, and you buy it. Without the proper legal setup and the law on your side, you cannot simply force this person from their home regardless if you own the digital version. As it currently stands, you&#8217;d need to fall back on the court system of your home country to settle the dispute.</p>
<p>In short, there are limitations to the technology and sometimes the lines of DeFi begin to blur. In due time, laws will adapt to the changing financial landscape and DeFi&#8217;s place in the world will become clearer. That being said, one thing is clear: DeFi is here to stay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CDP stands for Collateralized Debt Position. In laymen&#8217;s terms, it&#8217;s when you put up assets as collateral in order to take out a loan or debt against said collateral. When you&#8217;re talking about Ethereum, a CDP specifically refers to a position or loan taken out in DAI through the <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MakerDAO</a> smart contract which is backed by ETH.</p>
<p>When you open a MakerDAO CDP, you lock in ether (ETH) as collateral. And then, you&#8217;re able to mint up to 2/3 of the US dollar value of your ether in DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. In other words, your CDP must have at least 150% more collateral value than your total debt in DAI.</p>
<p>CDP holders pay an annual interest rate on their debts called the stability fee for the opportunity to mint new DAI. And when the debt is repaid, the DAI is burned along with the stability fee owed in Maker&#8217;s token MKR. The stability fee deters users from over-inflating the total supply of DAI.</p>
<p>For every 1 DAI, there is at least $1.50 worth of Ether (ETH) locked into a Maker CDP as collateral. And if your collateral value falls, you must lock in more ETH, pay back some of your debt, or risk having their CDP liquidated. When a CDP is liquidated, the ETH held as collateral is automatically sold to pay back the debts in addition to a penalty fee for failing to keep your collateral ratio above 150%.</p>

<h2>How do I open a CDP?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s quick and easy to open a CDP. Just head on over to MakerDAO&#8217;s <a href="https://cdp.makerdao.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portal</a>, send a few transactions&#8230; and then BAM! You&#8217;re the proud owner of a CDP.</p>
<p>First, connect your wallet and the menu will guide you through sending the transaction to open your CDP. Once you&#8217;ve opened your CDP, you&#8217;ll need to add some ETH to your CDP with the <em>&#8216;Deposit&#8217;</em> button. Next, click the <em>&#8216;Generate&#8217;</em> button to mint your desired amount of DAI.</p>
<p>And when you want to pay your debt back, return to this portal and use the &#8216;Pay Back&#8217; button. Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t have MKR for the stability fee because you can also pay it back with DAI. Now, you have the option to withdraw your collateral. Also, you can either close your CDP entirely or leave it open for later borrowing, it&#8217;s your choice.</p>
<p>Remember to keep in mind that you will owe interest on any DAI you borrow. Additionally, you won&#8217;t be able to access any ether you lock up in your CDP until your debt is paid. And if the price of ETH begins to fall, you may become at risk of liquidation if you don&#8217;t take action. We recommend you do not borrow the maximum amount possible and instead consider borrowing a smaller amount to reduce your risk of liquidation.</p>
<h2>Why open a CDP?</h2>
<p>The easy answer is: to have access to DAI. While the price of ETH may fluctuate, you can count on DAI to hover around $1. So there&#8217;s a natural demand for DAI in payments, commerce, games, lending, and many many more use cases. DAI has also become the de facto stablecoin for <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/best-decentralized-exchanges-dexes/">decentralized exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>The more complicated answer is that there are a number of reasons you might want to borrow against your ETH. Maybe you want the DAI to pay off other bills in your life but you don&#8217;t want to sell your ETH. Or, maybe you want to mint DAI to leverage yourself by purchasing other investments. There are numerous reasons you might want liquidity while still being exposed to the price of ETH.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, is the nickname of financial smart contracts, decentralized applications (DApps), and protocols built on Ethereum. Financial DApps are the hottest use case of Ethereum at the given moment.</p>
<p>One of the most unique parts of decentralized finance that the smart contracts are publicly accessible and highly interoperable. Similar to Lego, individual parts of DeFi can be pieced together to make something new. And so, decentralized finance excites many people because of how it empowers individuals and creates new opportunities like never before.</p>
<p>We built DeFi Pulse as a way for the community to follow trends in DeFi. Our DeFi Pulse leaderboard tracks the assets and their total value locked into the smart contracts that make up decentralized finance. Also, we compiled even more DeFi resources you can check out into <a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The DeFi List</a>.</p>
<figure id="attachment_7429" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7429" style="width: 415px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://defipulse.com/"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7429" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Selection_010-1024x936.jpg" alt="DeFi on Ethereum" width="415" height="379" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Selection_010-1024x936.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Selection_010-300x274.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Selection_010-768x702.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Selection_010.jpg 1042w" sizes="(max-width: 415px) 100vw, 415px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-7429" class="wp-caption-text">Screenshot of DeFi Pulse</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s break down each category of decentralized finance to shed some light onto this ecosystem.</p>
<h3>Lending</h3>
<p>One of the most popular use cases of DeFi is lending and borrowing tokens. Lending is an extremely popular way to earn passive income in DeFi. And while you may think lending to a stranger sounds risky, most loans made in DeFi are secured loans with more collateral than borrowed value. This reduces the risk for lenders.</p>
<p>MakerDAO is the most popular lending DApp that allows you to lock in ETH for a stablecoin called Dai, a token pegged to the USD. Dai provides a way for token holders to access liquidity at the cost of an annual interest rate. Dai plays a vital role in the DeFi community as the most popular stablecoin.</p>
<h3>DEXes</h3>
<div class="entry-content">
<p>Decentralized exchanges, or DEXes for short, are smart contracts that allow users to buy, sell, or trade cryptocurrencies or tokens. Because they live on the Ethereum blockchain, these exchanges operate without a central authority. Instead, the smart contracts enforce the rules, execute trades, and securely handle funds when necessary. Unlike a centralized exchange, there&#8217;s often no need to deposit your funds before making your swap. Try <a href="/blog/how-to-trade-on-a-dex/">trading on a DEX</a> for yourself.</p>
</div>
<h3>Derivatives</h3>
<p>A derivative is a contract, the value of which is determined by the performance of an underlying asset. Similarly, Derivative markets in DeFi trade nearly any asset on the blockchain using synthetic pricing. For example, synthetic price feeds create derivative tokens for stocks, futures, and even Bitcoin using smart contracts. In a similar way, prediction markets are another popular type of derivative market in DeFi. Prediction markets essentially let users bet on the outcome of any event.</p>
<h3>Payments</h3>
<p>The payments category is largely dominated by layer 2 payment channel networks. These networks are built on-top of existing blockchains like Ethereum or Bitcoin, AKA layer 1. Payment networks allow two parties to create instant transfer payment channels. As you may know, blockchains are only able to handle so many transactions in a timely manner. And so, layer 2 solutions allow users to trade a bit of the security and decentralization of Layer 1 for the convenience of speed. Ultimately, these qualities make layer 2 payment channels ideal for smaller, frequent payments like those found in commerce.</p>
<h3>Assets</h3>
<p>Tokenized assets and asset management is a quickly growing sector of DeFi. Existing financial assets deployed to the blockchain as tokens fit nicely into DeFi protocols which extend their utility. Asset management protocols allow investors to put their money in the hands of smart contracts or fund managers which manage their portfolio. Other asset management protocols, such as Set Protocol, employ automated strategies such as periodic rebalancing or following technical indicators.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2></h2>
<p>A coin burn is when you take cryptocurrency, coins, or tokens and destroy them. Many coins or tokens have built-in mechanisms which periodically burn a portion of their existing supply.</p>
<p>The idea is pretty simple. When you burn a coin, you lower the total supply of the coins in circulation. And according to the law of supply and demand, lowering the total supply of coins should theoretically increase its value as long as there is sufficient future demand for the coin.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7355 size-medium aligncenter" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/coinburn-300x300.png" alt="coin burn" width="300" height="300" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/coinburn-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/coinburn-150x150.png 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/coinburn-768x768.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/coinburn.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></h2>
<h2>A coin burn is similar to a stock buyback in traditional finance</h2>
<p>In traditional finance, companies will sometimes repurchase shares of their own stock. This is what&#8217;s called a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharerepurchase.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock buyback</a>. The company can either buy the shares off the open market or pay shareholders a fixed price per share. Either way, you as a shareholder get to sell your shares at a profit and the company gets to increase its price-to-earnings ratio. Companies have increasingly turned to stock buybacks over issuing dividends for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>If a company wants to bolster the performance of their stock price, they can buy back their own shares from the open market to drive up the price. Investors see this growth and the company can sell back later when it needs cash flow.</p>
<h2>Coin burn in action</h2>
<p>Developers have similar motivations for burning their coins or tokens. However, developers have the advantage of being able to program supply-reducing burning functions right into their smart contract. Let&#8217;s dive into a few examples of smart contracts on the Ethereum network with built-in mechanisms to burn their tokens.</p>
<h3>Maker (MKR) tokens and the Dai Stablecoin System</h3>
<p><a href="https://makerdao.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maker</a> (MKR) is an ERC20 token that governs a smart contract credit system. Maker&#8217;s smart contracts allow you to borrow the stablecoin Dai against the value of your ETH. When you open a collateralized debt position (CDP) to borrow DAI, you are minting new DAI tokens.</p>
<p>To ensure DAI is always pegged at $1, you&#8217;re charged a yearly interest rate or stability fee. The MakerDAO, compromised of MKR holders, is in charge of controlling this fee and the peg of DAI to the US dollar. When the peg slips, MKR token holders vote to adjust the fees to increase or decrease demand for DAI accordingly.</p>
<p>When you go to repay the debt on your CDP, you&#8217;ll owe the outstanding debt in DAI and any interest fees accrued in MKR tokens. In the repayement process, you&#8217;re actually burning both the DAI and MKR tokens. Much like a stock buyback, burning MKR increases the value of remaining supply of tokens on the market as an incentive to own MKR tokens. As a MKR holders, you&#8217;re incentivized to make sure things are running smoothly much like the shareholders of a company.</p>
<h3>Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://kyber.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyber Network</a> is an on-chain liquidity protocol which allows users to swap tokens through its liquidity providers. Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) is an ERC20 token involved in nearly every aspect of this decentralized liquidity network.</p>
<p>KNC utilizes a burning mechanism to take a portion of its token supply out of circulation with every swap. Whenever you swap tokens on the Kyber Network, you pay your transaction fees in KNC. some of which is burned. Kyber recently <a href="https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-ecosystem-report-3-b2dc8ba0e44a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that in May they had crossed 1,000,000 KNC tokens burned.</p>
<p>Although that&#8217;s not all its used for, Kyber Network utilizes its token in a variety of ways to align the goals of each participant. From paying fees to open a liquidity reserve to receiving kickbacks for referrals as a vendor, the idea is to create utility and thus demand for KNC.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A decentralized exchange, or DEX for short, is like a stock exchange run by a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Although both allow you to trade assets, a decentralized exchange trades cryptocurrency only and so does not require a centralized authority to operate. Instead, a decentralized exchange uses a smart contract to enforce the rules, execute trades, and securely handle funds when necessary.</p>
<h4>In order to examine the differences, let&#8217;s break down what a centralized exchange looks like in traditional finance.</h4>
<p>Exchanges are where you buy and sell things. More specifically, financial exchanges are where you trade financial assets and commodities. In traditional finance, these assets are held in custody by a central exchange who takes orders from buyers and sellers for commodities, stock, securities, currencies, and more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7391 size-medium" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="decentralized exchnage" width="300" height="200" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-1568x1045.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>To execute a trade, you submit an order to the exchange who then either puts it onto their orderbooks to be filled later or fills the order with an existing order on the books. When you make an order which gets put in the orderbook, it&#8217;s called a maker order. And when your trade order is filled by taking an existing one off the books, your order is considered a taker order.</p>
<h4>DEXes are exchanges built using smart contracts</h4>
<p>Decentralized exchanges are smart contracts written to perform a similar process as the one described above. They allow users to trade cryptocurrencies like ETH for other coins or tokens simply by interacting with their contracts from their wallet.</p>
<p>When you submit trade orders to a DEX, you&#8217;re submitting a transaction to their smart contract on the blockchain. Some DEXes have orderbooks with maker and taker orders. Whereas, other DEXes have pools or reserves of currencies ready to swaps or trades.</p>
<h4>Using a decentralized exchange reduces your risk of hack or theft</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s a risk to putting your money in someone else&#8217;s hands. This is especially true when it comes to cryptocurrency. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges hold millions of dollars of their customers&#8217; funds and are prime targets for hackers and thieves.</p>
<p>Decentralized exchanges reduce this risk by either letting you keep your funds in your wallet until the order is filled. Or rather, the funds are held in a smart contract secured by the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Try it our yourself! It&#8217;s easy; just use <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> to find the best prices from 10 different DEXes in one click. And then, just punch in your desire trading pair and amount, hit Buy Now, and in seconds you&#8217;ll have made your first trade on a DEX.</p>

<h3>cDai is like an instant Dai savings account</h3>
<p>Lending is one of the most popular ways in DeFi to earn interest. But did you know it just got easier than ever? As you may know, <a href="https://defipulse.com/compound'">Compound</a>, a money market protocol, allows you to earn a variable interest rate in return for supplying tokens that other users can borrow. The protocol recently upgraded to v2, which includes a big development that everyone&#8217;s talking about: the addition of Compound tokens, or <em>cTokens</em>, including cDai, cETH, and more.</p>
<p>Previously, Compound used a single smart contract for all assets. With the upgrade, each token on Compound has its own contract, called an <em>asset gateway</em>. That&#8217;s a big deal, because now when you deposit tokens into Compound, you get cTokens &#8211; ERC20 tokens that represent your lending or supply balance and the interest it has accrued.</p>
<p>So how does that work exactly?</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s look at an example</h3>
<p>Previously, in Compound v1, the interest you earned was simply added to your account balance, and it remained in Compound. However, now when you supply Dai to Compound in v2, you&#8217;ll receive cDai in exchange. The exchange rate began at 50 cDai for every one 1 Dai, and as interest accrues in the market, each cDai will be worth more Dai. The idea is that as your interest accrues, you&#8217;ll need less cTokens to redeem your underlying assets. In other words, the exchange rate between Dai and cDai grows proportionally with the interest rate.</p>
<h3>What makes cDai so awesome?</h3>
<p>The simple answer is that by designing cTokens as ERC20 tokens, Compound has opened up a whole new world of functionality and liquidity. All the assets that used to stay locked away in Compound are now free to move about the ecosystem, ready to be utilized for other purposes.</p>
<p>You can transfer, trade, or send cTokens to cold storage, just like any other token on Ethereum. In fact, you can even integrate them into other protocols. That is, any protocol where you can lock tokens could choose to accept any cToken. This would allow you to earn interest on top of the benefits the protocol already gives you.</p>
<h3>Showcasing DeFi&#8217;s composability</h3>
<p>The perfect example of this new interoperability is the <a href="https://defipulse.com/uniswap">Uniswap</a> Dai-to-cDai liquidity pool. Users (and smart contracts) can swap their Dai or any token for that matter into cTokens to take advantage of Compound&#8217;s interest-based exchange rate. And compared to simply holding Dai, pooling cDai earns you interest while also exposing you to trading fees on Uniswap.</p>
<p><strong>You can try it right now</strong>: start earning interest by swapping any token for cDai in seconds with <a href="http://cDAI.io/">cDAI.io</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to see what other unique and creative ways the community will take advantage of cTokens. Tell us what you think about cDai &#8211; or any other DeFi stuff &#8211; on <a href="https://twitter.com/defipulse/">Twitter</a> or in the Concourse <a href="https://discord.gg/S4zZG6H">Discord</a>.</p>
