										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) took over the world in 2021. While some people still can&#8217;t fully grasp their value proposition, they are an obsession for many others. Artists, collectors and investors have found fertile ground in the blockchain space, where they can trade and speculate on the price of intangible assets. And more importantly, do it seamlessly without auctioneers or any other middlemen. This is where <a href="https://defipulse.com/dodo">DODO</a>’s brand new feature allowing users to fractionalize NFTs called <a href="http://dodonft.io/">DODO NFT</a> comes in. With DODO NFTs, everyone is able to participate in the NFTs ecosystem by leveraging DODO’s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dodo-and-proactive-market-making/">Proactive Market Maker</a> (PMM) protocol.</p>



<h2>Why fractionalize NFTs?</h2>



<p>Although the NFTs ecosystem has seen enormous growth and success in the past months, creating a market for NFTs can still be difficult for many creators. Since NFTs are non-divisible by definition, their price discovery process is hard; ask and bid prices on NFTs usually have huge discrepancies and the most wanted items have prohibitive prices for the small investors and collectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way to overcome the hurdle of price discovery is with DODO’s approach to the concept of fractionalizing NFTs, which can give rise to a highly active and efficient secondary market. In DODO’s proposed mechanism, an NFT or a collection of NFTs are placed in a vault contract and then fragmented into sub-units by issuing ERC20 (fungible tokens) that represent the ownership of the vault. With this process, anyone can buy a fraction or share of an NFT, regardless of the amount of capital they can invest.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jZP26I8hJDnvCEPmyR7hOnuwyZa5nKjXtEay_MFp4xIlp8zD45R-TvmDSEQr-pMCPaNCMyabEdaleujeIkk4yeY6mLGgSR2IqNLWmIIKV8wCmJDVeklpjd_cDgfzsAqPiwh3hF3H" alt="The fractionalization process using DODO"/><figcaption>The fractionalization process using DODO</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Owning an NFT collectively can be very appealing. The power of community ownership comes from an alignment of values and vision surpasses the amount of interest and money one individual can have. Fractionalizing an NFT collectible can also be powerful from a distribution point of view since, as more people own an NFT the more it signals the value of it to the community.<br></p>



<h2>Create flexible NFT markets with DODO’s PMM</h2>



<p>With DODO NFT, powered by DODO’s established Proactive Market Maker (PMM), creators can easily fractionalize NFTs and bootstrap a market with interconnected liquidity. DODO NFT’s complete suite of tools allows anyone to handle all the processes related to fragmentation, from the vault creation, the ERC20 tokens issuance, the contracts and the creation of dedicated DODO PMMs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO NFT represents a brand-new solution to pricing and liquidity formation of an NFT marketplace. To begin with, the vault contract can hold various assets, including one or more NFTs or a combination of selected ERC20 tokens, serving as an individual or an organization&#8217;s portfolio. Creators of DODO NFT Vaults can also choose to issue a predetermined amount of fungible tokens and select how many will be assigned to the team and how many will go directly to provide liquidity for the PMM.</p>



<h2>What is different from a traditional AMM pool?</h2>



<p>Suppose you issued a certain amount of tokens for an NFT community sale. Automated market makers that use a constant product approach, such as Uniswap V2, require initial liquidity to be deposited in order to set the initial price of the asset. If you want to create a liquidity market for all tokens, you will need to provide an equal amount of money as the bid-side liquidity to achieve the desired initial price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO proactive markets allow you to provide single-sided liquidity. You can build a DODO NFT market and proactively set the starting price for a fragmented token without committing any capital. As traders buy the fungible tokens, the price will automatically increase following a curve. One other crucial contrast to automated market makers that use a constant product approach is that, in the former, only a single price curve is supported, while in the case of DODO PMM, it allows you to set a Slippage Coefficient (k) that gives the flexibility to handle different markets situations.<br><br>Below we can observe different price curves that can be set up with DODO PMM. The simplest one is when k=0. In this curve, the price doesn&#8217;t change with the amount sold. Any token will always be sold for the same price. In the opposite spectrum, k=1, the price increases with the amount sold in the same behavior as the constant product function. It&#8217;s possible to set more smooth curves choosing intermediary values for k. DODO PMM pools also allow for the customization of the trading fees collected from buyers rather than a fixed 0.3% fee.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dodo-Curves-1024x446.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9228"/><figcaption>NFT PMM price curves with different “Slippage Coefficient” k.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Splitting up the DODO NFT Vault into fungible tokens can lead to a powerful mechanism as it allows composability to many other DeFi protocols. The underlying tokens can then be accessed using different DEXes and trading routes to be exchanged with any other token. They could even possibly be used as collateral for borrowing other assets like say for derivatives trading or even as a part of an NFT index primitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em style=""><b>In this edition of DeFi Dive, Daniel Wang, founder and CEO of Loopring, discusses how zkRollups can scale high-throughput DeFi applications like Loopring.io while </b></em><strong><em>maintaining layer 1 security.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I learned Bitcoin back in 2013 when I was working for JD.com as a senior engineering director. Later I quit JD.com and built a centralized exchange in China, which listed BTC, Ripple, and some other cryptocurrencies. The multiple hacks of exchanges during 2014 &#8211; 2017 made me think about what technicalities can be used to create a better kind of crypto exchanges that can offer much higher security for user assets. </p>



<p>When Ethereum came out, we formed a team to verify a straightforward idea: using smart-contract to build an exchange to trade tokens. We believe a well audited smart-contract exchange should offer the same level of security as the assets. That&#8217;s the beginning of Loopring, but the project ends up with a very different technical solution that we have never imagined.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>Loopring, in its latest version (3.0), is the first zkRollup-based exchange protocol that can settle more than 2K trades per second without sacrificing the layer1 security and incurs less than 200USD per million settlements. We have just started to operate an exchange built on top of this protocol &#8211; the Loopring Exchange, aka Loopring.io. </p>



<p>However, this is not the end of the protocol or the exchange. We are working on versions that will offer better support for onchain composability and easier customization. With the new version, multiple exchanges built on top of the same protocol may have very different DeFi properties and business models. We believe zkRollup is the right solution for scalability, not just for exchanges, but many dApps that are designed to target millions of active users.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>We target people who use centralized exchanges. As of now, DeFi&#8217;s active user base is still very small, and DeFi onboarding is quite challenging for users without a technical background. With our new smart wallet app (launching later this year), we hope to offer a mobile platform for a massive user base with a language they speak and a set of features they can quickly understand. Eventually, security will be part of the minimum requirement a crypto platform shall offer, not a feature that we now talk about so often.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>Loopring 3.5 is something we look forward to, and it will be code-complete very soon. We also expect Loopring Wallet to make a difference in terms of user acquisition.</p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>Orderbook-based exchanges are essential infrastructures for cryptocurrencies, and they fulfill user needs and will remain the dominant form of trading for the massive, even in the future. We believe Loopring is on the right track, and with continuous optimizations and improvements, we will remain competitive and gradually eliminate the centralized exchange technical stack.</p>



<h3>What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>Serious investors should be concerned with DeFi&#8217;s ever-growing complexity and composability. Our crypto-assets on these products are only as secure as the weakest link in the stack. I do not participate in DeFi aggressively as the return doesn&#8217;t justify the risk for the asset I put in. I&#8217;m not saying we should not participate in DeFi at all, but a wise thing to do is only to invest want we can afford to lose.</p>



<h3>How can readers learn more about your product/service?</h3>



<p>The best source of information regarding Loopring is our <a href="https://loopring.org/">website</a>. For engineers and hackers, our <a href="https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/blob/master/packages/loopring_v3/DESIGN.md">design doc</a> is where they can find the most technical details. </p>

<p>If you ask me, the most exciting part of decentralized finance is seeing DeFi&#8217;s money legos stacking up over time. Futureswap, launching Monday afternoon PST (April 20th, 2020), is a great example of how decentralized finance iterates on past successes to evolve into something even better.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0"><img loading="lazy" width="2488" height="1168" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8166" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1.png 2488w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-300x141.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-1024x481.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-768x361.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-1536x721.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-2048x961.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-1568x736.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2488px) 100vw, 2488px" /></a></figure>



<h2>Futureswap is like a blend of Uniswap and BitMEX</h2>



<p><a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0">Futureswap</a> is a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) perpetual futures platform where users can trade any ERC20 token with up to 20x leverage. These perpetual futures have no time limits and can remain open as long as the trader has enough collateral.</p>



<p>Similar to Uniswap, users deposit equal parts of token and stablecoin (i.e. ETH/DAI) and are issued ownership shares of the liquidity pool. With Futureswap, users can enter long or short leveraged future positions which are matched by liquidity pools. </p>



<p>But here&#8217;s where things get interesting:<strong> Futureswap has zero slippage for any size trade and 100% pooled assets can be utilized.</strong> Liquidity providers can earn trade trading fees and borrowing fees on up to 100% of their deposits. And so, Futureswap pools can be very efficient with their use of capital resulting in more stability and potentially high returns for liquidity providers compared to traditional AMM exchanges.</p>



<h3>Dynamic Funding Rate (DFR)</h3>



<p>Futureswap has a unique mechanism called the dynamic funding rate or DFR for short. The DFR is a borrowing fee based on the total trade size designed to maintain the volume balance between open longs and shorts. During times of disproportionate demand, liquidity providers&#8217; pooled assets are used to take up the opposite side of any unmatched trades. So if there were tons of unmatched ETH longs, LPs cover the ETH essentially opening a short.</p>



<p>Long and short volumes are pooled and here&#8217;s the kicker: <strong><strong>the more popular pool</strong> is charged the dynamic funding rate and it&#8217;s paid to the pool in low demand. </strong>The DFR keeps increasing as the disparity grows to disincentivize trades on the popular side. In other words, the longs pay the shorts or vice versa until the sides become balanced. This mechanism limits extreme volatility and properly rewards liquidity providers for their exposure to risk.</p>



<p>So what are the risks for liquidity providers if worse comes to worst and 100% of the traders are short and the price decreases? Liquidity providers essentially have the same exposure as if they were holding 100% of the token instead of 50% token and 50% stablecoin. While it&#8217;s still a risk, the dynamic funding rate lowers the likelihood of such a situation happening.</p>



<h2>Incentives designed to benefit all involved</h2>



<p>On top of trading and borrowing fees, Futureswap has its own token called Futureswap Tokens (FST) which creates incentives that reward the users that contribute the most to the system. </p>



<h3>Futureswap Tokens (FST)</h3>



<p>Futureswap Tokens (FST) are non-transferable tokens given out weekly to traders, liquidity providers, and referrers and are used to govern Futureswap as well as incentivize user participation. </p>



<p><strong>FST tokens are distributed weekly according to your portion of the total trade volume, liquidity provided, and/or referrals. </strong>Essentially, the more you use Futureswap, the more FST you earn over time.</p>



<h3>Trading Fee Discounts</h3>



<p>Traders earn FST based on their total weekly trades proportional to the total trade volume for that week. The higher your % of total trading volume, the higher your weekly FST reward.</p>



<p>Traders who hold FST also receive discounts on their trading fees. These discounts are calculated on a logarithmic curve and can reduce trading fees by up to 30%. The cool part is that you aren&#8217;t required to burn the tokens to receive the discount.</p>



<h3>Earn FST with Referrals</h3>



<p>Futureswap has built-in referral rewards for users who drive trading volume to the platform. Referrer FST earnings are based on closed trade volume of users you refer in proportion to total closed trade volume of users from other referrers. </p>



<p>Anyone can create a referral link for their Ethereum address and start earning fees by simply adding to the Futureswap links ?src=[YOU ADDRESS HERE] parameter.  </p>



<p>For example<a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0x1E042E6a150961E3aC07b7eF0643776A5b6a73ac">,</a> here&#8217;s what our referral link looks like <a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0">https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0</a>. <br><em>We appreciate any use of our referral link as it helps support DeFi Pulse.</em></p>



<h3>Governance proposals</h3>



<p>Futureswap is designed to be fully decentralized and community-run as soon as possible. The distribution of FST rewards the most active users for participating. These FST holders then create and vote on new proposals like adding new trading pairs and changing system parameters. Stakeholders must burn FST to create new proposals.</p>



<h3>Reflections on Futureswap&#8217;s design</h3>



<p>As I dug into Futureswap to write this post, I grew to appreciate its design. From the DFR to the distribution of FST, the Futureswap team has paid a particular attention to detail. </p>



<p>For example, Futureswap trading pairs use Chainlink for their price feed oracles. The system also has built-in protections against front running attacks. New position creation timestamps are checked relative to the Chainlink price update. If the new position is opened within a 3 minute window before the price update, the system bumps the user up to the next price on trade close. </p>



<h2>The early bird gets the worm</h2>



<p>The truth is that being an early adopter comes with its advantages. Futureswap Tokens will be distributed to the platform&#8217;s most active users. Futureswap&#8217;s design utilizes FST to incentivize users to participate when activity is low. </p>



<p>Early Futureswap adopters are more likely to have larger contributions proportional to the system total thus earning more FST. So it stands to reason that you&#8217;ll earn more FST by participating sooner rather than later after the community grows even larger and more active.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is changing the way people interact with their money.  However, we know it can be a lot to take in. Don&#8217;t worry, because we&#8217;ve put together this quick guide to give you jump start.</p>
<h2>Start making money on DeFi in 4 steps</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with Ethereum, these steps will only take a few minutes. And when it&#8217;s all said and done, you&#8217;ll be earning interest in DAI every block. <em><strong>However if you&#8217;re completely new to Ethereum,</strong></em> you may instead want to check out <strong><a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/zero-to-defi-cdai/">Zero to DeFi</a></strong>, a beginner&#8217;s guide which breaks down the entire process of getting a wallet, acquiring ETH, and lending out your DAI.</p>
<h3>1. Get ETH into an address that you own</h3>
<p>As the saying goes, if you don&#8217;t hold the private keys to the wallet, then they aren&#8217;t your coins. So, be sure to perform these steps from a wallet that you hold the private keys to. And, don&#8217;t forget to keep them backed up somewhere safe.</p>
<h3>2. Head to <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> and sell most of that ETH for DAI</h3>
<p><a href="http://DEX.AG/">DEX.AG</a> is a decentralized exchange or DEX aggregator that gets you the best price available from several of the most popular DEXes. It even splits your trade across multiple DEXes if it improves the price, all in one transaction. <strong>Make sure to leave a little ETH leftover for <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/what-is-gas/">gas fees</a>.</strong></p>

<h3>4. Pick a lending protocol, and start earning interest</h3>
<p>Enter the asset and amount you wish to lend to find which lending protocol has the best interest rate. Pick a protocol and click the &#8216;Next&#8217; button which will redirect you to that app/service. Compound finance is currently the most popular lending protocol. Follow the app&#8217;s instructions to begin lending out your DAI and start earning interest.</p>
<h3>And then later, when you&#8217;re ready to cash out&#8230;</h3>
<p>Head back to the lending protocol you chose and use your private key to unlock the DAI plus interest generated whenever you want. There&#8217;s no &#8220;lock-in&#8221; period or time you have to wait before earning interest. Your DAI is earning interest every block until you choose to stop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You&#8217;re probably familiar with traditional cryptocurrency exchanges like <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/daley_e6">Coinbase</a> or <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/register?ref=QVZBT755">Binance</a>. And, you probably know that these exchanges are run by central authorities which hold your funds in custody while you trade. This puts your money out of your control and at risk of theft.</p>
<p>But did you know that many decentralized exchanges or DEXs allow you to make trades directly from your wallet? In fact, in many cases when you trade on a DEX, the funds never leave your wallet which means you avoid paying withdrawal fees on money that&#8217;s yours to begin with. But how does that work?</p>
<h2>DEXs are smart contracts</h2>
<p>Decentralized exchanges are smart contracts that exist on the blockchain. These smart contracts enable peer-to-peer trading by connecting buyers and sellers. There are several ways that decentralized exchanges can provide liquidity to traders. One popular method is to have users supply the coins, tokens, or liquidity necessary for the smart contract to perform trades on demand. These funds are held in the smart contract.</p>
<p>Another way is to keep an orderbook of proposed trades to be submitted to the blockchain later. Users can either propose a trade and sign a transaction or order saying they are willing to trade a set amount of tokens at a set price. Or, you can take an order off the books by signing the other half of a proposed transaction. When the buyer and seller are matched, the transaction signed by both parties is submitted to the blockchain and the funds are swapped between the two users&#8217; wallet.</p>
<p>In both cases, the funds either never leave your wallet or are securely held in a smart contract instead of some company holding your money. And, user like yourself that provide liquidity to a DEX earn a cut of the fees that would usually go to an exchange.</p>
<h3>Smart contracts are open for anyone to use</h3>
<p>When you think of an exchange or DEX, you&#8217;re probably thinking of a website. And while it is true, you usually use a web interface to interact with DEXs; the smart contract behind the website you use to &#8220;trade on a DEX&#8221; is what actually makes the magic happen.</p>
<p>Think of an interface like a keyboard; your computer doesn&#8217;t care what type of keyboard your using. The only thing that matters is that the keyboard is inputting the correct data. Smart contracts are like your computer in this case. They don&#8217;t care how you interact with them as long as you input the right information into the DEX. And so, this means that you can use any interface you want to trade using these DEX smart contracts.</p>
<h2>Get the best-priced trades with DEX.AG</h2>
<p>If you have the choice to use any interface, why not choose one that is convenient and saves you time and money? That&#8217;s what <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> was built for. In the past, you would have had to run around to each DEX and compare prices, but those days are over. DEX.AG checks 10 different decentralized exchanges to find you the best price so you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>You start by picking whether you&#8217;re trying to buy or sell a token at the top of the screen. Next, select the token and the amount you&#8217;re looking to trade. And then, hit the Find Trades button.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7372" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-1024x588.png" alt="trade on a dex" width="900" height="517" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-1024x588.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-300x172.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-768x441.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-1536x882.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade-1568x901.png 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/dexagtrade.png 1635w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></p>
<p>The exchange found at the top of the list will be the best trade available on the market for the trading pair and amount you&#8217;ve chosen. Click the &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; button and MetaMask will walk you through submitting your trade to the DEX. However, if you haven&#8217;t previously interacted with the DEX, you&#8217;ll be required to send an approval transaction to the smart contract first.</p>
<p>After hitting submit, your trade will be complete as soon as your transaction is confirmed. Well would you look at that, you&#8217;ve completed your first trade on a DEX in just a few clicks!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A decentralized exchange, or DEX for short, is like a stock exchange run by a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Although both allow you to trade assets, a decentralized exchange trades cryptocurrency only and so does not require a centralized authority to operate. Instead, a decentralized exchange uses a smart contract to enforce the rules, execute trades, and securely handle funds when necessary.</p>
<h4>In order to examine the differences, let&#8217;s break down what a centralized exchange looks like in traditional finance.</h4>
<p>Exchanges are where you buy and sell things. More specifically, financial exchanges are where you trade financial assets and commodities. In traditional finance, these assets are held in custody by a central exchange who takes orders from buyers and sellers for commodities, stock, securities, currencies, and more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7391 size-medium" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="decentralized exchnage" width="300" height="200" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-1568x1045.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>To execute a trade, you submit an order to the exchange who then either puts it onto their orderbooks to be filled later or fills the order with an existing order on the books. When you make an order which gets put in the orderbook, it&#8217;s called a maker order. And when your trade order is filled by taking an existing one off the books, your order is considered a taker order.</p>
<h4>DEXes are exchanges built using smart contracts</h4>
<p>Decentralized exchanges are smart contracts written to perform a similar process as the one described above. They allow users to trade cryptocurrencies like ETH for other coins or tokens simply by interacting with their contracts from their wallet.</p>
<p>When you submit trade orders to a DEX, you&#8217;re submitting a transaction to their smart contract on the blockchain. Some DEXes have orderbooks with maker and taker orders. Whereas, other DEXes have pools or reserves of currencies ready to swaps or trades.</p>
<h4>Using a decentralized exchange reduces your risk of hack or theft</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s a risk to putting your money in someone else&#8217;s hands. This is especially true when it comes to cryptocurrency. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges hold millions of dollars of their customers&#8217; funds and are prime targets for hackers and thieves.</p>
<p>Decentralized exchanges reduce this risk by either letting you keep your funds in your wallet until the order is filled. Or rather, the funds are held in a smart contract secured by the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Try it our yourself! It&#8217;s easy; just use <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> to find the best prices from 10 different DEXes in one click. And then, just punch in your desire trading pair and amount, hit Buy Now, and in seconds you&#8217;ll have made your first trade on a DEX.</p>
