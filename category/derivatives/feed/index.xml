										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The DeFi ecosystem is growing at a breathtaking pace. Unsurprisingly, staying on top of everything in the space is becoming practically impossible. DeFi is becoming increasingly sophisticated each day as the building blocks or rather money legos fall into place. Most people can tell you the basics of spot and margin trading, but I&#8217;ve started to see more and more people admit they know are unfamiliar with options trading. And, that&#8217;s okay because as many will tell you being a fan of DeFi often times means being a student. We&#8217;ve teamed up with folks behind ACO to explore how options fit into DeFi and how you might take advantage of options in your trading strategy. <a href="https://aco.finance/">ACO</a> is a decentralized non-custodial options protocol created by <a href="https://auctus.org/">Auctus</a>.</p>



<h2>What is an option?</h2>



<p>If you&#8217;re not familiar with the term, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp">options</a> are financial derivatives that offers the option contract holder the opportunity to buy or sell an asset for a specific strike price within a specific time period. In other words, a &#8220;call option&#8221; contract gives you the <em>option</em> to buy an asset at a given price before it expires by &#8220;exercising the option&#8221; as it&#8217;s called. A &#8220;put option&#8221; allows you to exercise the contract and sell at the strike price before the expiration date. Options are different from simply purchasing the underlying asset because you only pay the contract premium initially until you exercise the contract, allowing traders to hedge risks or trade with more leverage at a lower capital cost.</p>



<p>This is what makes options different from spot trading or even future contracts: you have no obligation to exercise the contract thus buying/selling the underlying asset. If the trade wouldn&#8217;t be in your favor, you can simply let the option contract expire and only be out the premium you paid to purchase the contract. On the flipside, the individual who wrote that option contract earns that premium if it expires without being exercised.</p>



<h2>What is ACO?</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-medium"><a href="https://aco.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="300" height="300" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aco-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8453" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aco-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aco-1024x1024.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aco-150x150.png 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aco-768x768.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/08/aco.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>ACO is a decentralized non-custodial options protocol that allows users to trustlessly trade, mint, and exercise call and put options. ACO protocol tokenizes put and call options contracts creating ERC20 tokens which you can send, trade, or even integrate ACO Tokens into other DeFi projects. Each ACO token option has its own smart contract programmed with the terms of the option contract. Additionally, these terms are also included in the ticker symbol of the ACO token.</p>



<p>ACO tokens’ symbols consists of four parts:</p>



<ol><li class="">Symbol of the underlying asset</li><li class="">Strike price &amp; Strike Asset</li><li class="">Option type, either P or C, for put or call</li><li class="">Expiration</li></ol>



<p>Take for example: <strong>ACO ETH-200USDC-C-26JUN20-0800UTC</strong></p>



<p>The above symbol represents a call option on ETH, expiring on 26 June 2020 08:00 UTC, with a strike price of 200 USDC.</p>



<p>Auctus, the team behind ACO, has deployed an interface <a href="https://aco.finance/">ACO.finance </a>that allows you to mint, manage and trade ACO tokens (which powered by 0x protocol). ACO Protocol and the interface have been <a href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/aco-protocol-audit/">audited by OpenZepplin</a>. More on ACO protocol in a bit, but first let&#8217;s explore some of the ways ACO option tokens are utilized by DeFi users.</p>



<h2>How do I trade options in DeFi?</h2>



<p>Now at this point, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re itching to see how you might take advantage of options. Let&#8217;s take a moment and break down a few situations where options could be a useful tool in your trading strategy. </p>



<h3>Use Call Options to speculate on rising ETH prices</h3>



<p>If you expect the price of ETH to rise, you can purchase ETH call options to take advantage of leverage, gaining positive exposure to ETH with less money than outright purchasing ETH at spot prices.</p>



<p>Let’s assume ETH is currently trading for $400. You could buy 100 ETH for a total of $40,000  and be completely exposed to the price of ETH. Or, you could buy 100 ETH calls with a $400 strike price for $8.00 and have a similar exposure but do so with only $800 ($8 X 100 = 800).</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure you can see how this is advantageous. If the price goes up as you expect, you&#8217;ll be able to break even at $408 (the strike price $400 + the $8 premium). However if the price of ETH goes sideways or falls, you might be able to sell the option for a loss (less of a premium) or you can simply let your contract expire without exercising it and only be out the money you spent on the premium.</p>



<h3>Use Put Options to hedge against declining ETH prices without limiting your exposure</h3>



<p>If you aren&#8217;t confident in the market and want to protect yourself ETH&#8217;s price falling, you can purchase ETH put options to hedge your bets without selling your ETH or losing your potential upside if the price rises. You can think of ETH put options as a form of insurance which costs you a premium to cover potential losses.</p>



<p>If ETH is currently trading at $380 and you want to protect yourself against it falling below $360 but don&#8217;t want to sell your 100 ETH quite yet. You could buy 100 put options with a $360 strike price for $4 and pay $400 to have the ability to sell your 100 ETH at $360 if the price of ETH were to drop before your options expire.</p>



<p>Options tend to give you more time to make a decision when compared to stop orders which are final once filled. Unlike a stop order, you can always wait to see if the price rebounds in your favor.</p>



<h2>Earn income by writing options on ACO</h2>



<p>As previously mentioned, you can write options contracts and potentially earn a premium on any unexercised contracts. Needless to say, signing a contract to buy or sell an asset comes with its risks. As a writer of an option, you may be obligated to sell your underlying asset at the strike price if the holder exercises the contract. We urge you as always to do your own research and to take into account these considerations before writing/minting your first option.</p>



<h3>Write ETH Call Options to earn income on your ETH</h3>



<p>Say you have ETH that you&#8217;re willing to part with for the right price. Using options, you can receive money today for your willingness to sell your ETH at a higher price.</p>



<p>Say ETH is at $380, you could mint and sell 100 ETH call options with a $420 strike price at a $9 premium and collect $900 on your willingness to sell your ETH. If things go sideways or your option expires before being exercised, you get to pocket the premium and keep your ETH. Of course, you&#8217;re still exposed to the price of ETH and will be obligated to sell the your ETH at the strike price if your option contract is exercised by the holder.</p>



<p>There a plenty of factors to it for sure but I think you can see how in right situation writing ETH call options could be a way to capitalize on a sideways or bear market.</p>



<h3>Write Put Options to earn income on your USDC</h3>



<p>Do you have USDC on the side waiting to buy ETH at a price below the current? You could earn a little extra income by writing and selling ETH put options. </p>



<p>Let’s assume ETH is currently trading for $380. You would like to buy 200 ETH if it drops to $300. You could write 200 ETH puts with a $300 strike at $4 and collect $800 on your willingness to buy 200 ETH at $300. Unlike setting a limit order, options let you collect money today for being willing to assume the obligation of buying ETH at the strike price.</p>



<p>By using this strategy, you can generate additional returns in your stablecoin holdings by collecting a premium for your willingness to be obligated to buy a ETH at a price that is below current price.</p>



<h2>ACO Protocol and its use of money legos</h2>



<p>Many aspects of their design make ACO Option Tokens a nice addition to existing money legos, but its the team&#8217;s use of existing money legos to create new functionality that I found the most fascinating.</p>



<h3>Flash Exercise</h3>



<p>This is by far one of the coolest parts of ACO. ACO has a feature called &#8220;flash exercise&#8221; which, as its name eludes to, allows you to cover the cost of exercising your ACO options using Uniswap V2 flash swaps leaving you with the remaining profits. Uniswap V2 flash swaps let you withdraw tokens from Uniswap&#8217;s reserves as long as you pay back the tokens in the same transaction. ACO&#8217;s flash exercise makes use of this by withdrawing the tokens necessary to exercise your options contract and then repaying the withdrawn tokens by swapping the underlying asset all in one transaction.</p>



<p><em>Net Profit = Number of Options * (( Uniswap Price &#8211; Strike Price ) / Uniswap Price )</em></p>



<p><strong>Essentially, you can always exercise profitable options contracts in one transaction even if you don&#8217;t have the funds available to buy/sell the asset before expiration. </strong>This opens the door for traders who might want to greater exposure with less funds.</p>



<h3>Governance</h3>



<p>Currently, the ACO protocol allows a single address to modify parameters, create new options series, add new strike assets and change the template for tokens that will be created in the future. The admin key which controls this address is currently administered by the Auctus team. However, the team plans to ultimately transition control to holders of their AUC token. Once launched, the governance dashboard and system which will allow AUC holders to decide which assets should be supported by the protocol and what fee percentage should be charged and used to buy back and burn AUC.</p>



<p>One key aspects of the current design which you may have noticed is that these parameters only affect future ACO option tokens. <strong>The protocol&#8217;s admin key has no ability to affect existing tokens</strong>, only you have access to your funds and all contracts are exercised in a non-custodial fashion.</p>



<h3>Coming up on the roadmap &#8211; YFI, Chainlink, and more</h3>



<p>YFI put and call options will be added to ACO within the next few weeks. Options will open the door for new strategies for the yearn.finance community. Auctus eventually plans to release an ACO OTC platform allowing users to trade customized options p2p, allowing greater variations of strike prices and expiration dates.</p>



<p>One of the next crucial components for ACO as a platform is the addition of an automated market maker (AMM) for ACO tokens. The AMM would provide option contract holders, whether it be a trader or a smart contract, with constant on-chain liquidity for ACO Tokens. </p>



<p>To further improve decentralization, the team is also looking to create volatility oracles with Chainlink.</p>



<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>



<p>Watching DeFi mature has been exhilarating. As each building block is produced, you can see some things like options coming from a mile away. But, I can tell you I didn&#8217;t see something like flash exercise coming. It really goes to show how innovations build on one another so quickly in this space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DeFi is an abbreviation of the phrase <strong>decentralized finance</strong> which generally refers to the digital assets and financial smart contracts, protocols, and decentralized applications (DApps) built on Ethereum. In simpler terms, it&#8217;s financial software built on the blockchain that can be pieced together like Money Legos.</p>
<p>To get a feel for the products and services that exist in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, you can check out our <a href="https://defipulse.com/">DeFi rankings</a> which tracks the current value locked into popular DeFi smart contracts.</p>
<p>Computers have disrupted nearly every industry over the years. Each innovation builds on the previous one, and digital products and services become more sophisticated. Through technology, we&#8217;ve catered the world to fit our needs. From digital assistants to home automation, programs now affect many aspects of your daily life. So why would money be any different?</p>
<h2>What is decentralized finance and who is it for?</h2>
<p>To better understand DeFi, we should first take a look at how traditional finance came about. Although it sometimes feels like money has always been around, that&#8217;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>Humans originally bartered for the goods and services. But as human societies formed and developed, so did our economies. We invented currency to make exchanging things of value easier. Subsequently, currency helped usher in new innovations and higher levels of economic productivity. However, progress didn&#8217;t come without its cost.</p>
<p>Historically, central authorities such as governments have issued the currencies that underpin our economies. Central banks and institutions were expected to carefully manage and regulate the supply of currency in circulation. As the size and complexity of our economies grew, these central authorities gained more power as more people placed trust in them.</p>
<p>You trust your government to not print more money overnight. You trust your bank to safely store your money. And, when it comes to investing, you trust your assets to a financial adviser. By handing control of your money over to others, you hope to earn a profit. But the sad truth about our current financial system is that the power that comes along with this trust isn&#8217;t always rewarded.</p>
<p>We often have very little say in how corporations handle our investments, or even how our governments manage the economy. And in most cases, investors only receive a fraction of the returns generated from the risks taken by these central authorities.</p>
<h4>DeFi is trying to build something different</h4>
<p>Decentralized finance aims to create a financial system that&#8217;s open to everyone and minimizes one&#8217;s need to trust and rely on central authorities. Technologies like the internet, cryptography, and blockchain give us the tools to collectively build and control a financial system without the need for central authorities.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a saying in the blockchain space: &#8220;Don&#8217;t trust, verify.&#8221; Because with a blockchain network, you as an individual can verify any and every transaction that occurs on the blockchain.</p>
<h3>DeFi allows everyone to take charge of their financial well-being</h3>
<p>Almost all DeFi applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain, the world&#8217;s most popular programmable blockchain. Ethereum is a blockchain network that maintains a shared ledger of digital value. Instead of a central authority, the participants that comprise the network control the issuance of ether (ETH), the network’s native cryptocurrency, in a decentralized manner.</p>
<p>Developers can program applications on Ethereum that can create, store, and manage digital assets, also called tokens, on the blockchain. These are called <strong>smart contracts </strong>or <strong>decentralized applications (DApps)</strong>. They’re contracts or agreements enforced by the Ethereum blockchain. Or rather, applications or scripts that run only as programmed on the Ethereum network. You can build complex irreversible agreements without the need for a middle man.</p>
<p>Decentralized finance has the opportunity to bring about a more resilient and transparent financial system. Anyone with an internet connection is able to access and interact with smart contracts built on the Ethereum blockchain. Many smart contracts are built to be open-source and interoperable with existing smart contracts. So, users can verify the smart contracts&#8217; code and choose which services work best for them.</p>
<h4>What are some examples of popular DeFi applications?</h4>
<p>There are <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-on-ethereum/">many different DeFi products and services</a>, some of which you may find familiar to existing financial services but with a decentralized twist.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most popular and fasting growing sector of DeFi is borrowing and lending platforms. Similar to a bank, users deposit money and earn interest from other users borrowing their assets. However, in this case the assets are digital and smart contracts connect the lenders to borrowers, enforce the terms of the loans, and distribute the interest. And it all happens without the need to trust one another or middleman bank. And, by cutting out the middleman, lenders can <a href="https://www.defipulse.com/income">earn higher returns</a> and more clearly understand the risks thanks to the transparency blockchain provides.</p>
<p>Tokens called stablecoins are also important to the DeFi ecosystem. You may be under the impression that all cryptocurrency is volatile. However, stablecoins are tokens designed to hold a specific value and are typically pegged to fiat currency like the US dollar. For example, DAI is a stablecoin pegged to USD and backed by ether (ETH). For every DAI, there is $1.50 of ETH locked into the <a href="http://makerdao.com/">MakerDAO</a> smart contract as collateral.</p>
<p>Another type of popular DeFi application is what&#8217;s called a <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange/">decentralized exchange</a>, or DEX for short. DEXes are cryptocurrency exchanges that use smart contracts to enforce the trading rules, execute trades, and securely handle funds when necessary. When you <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-to-trade-on-a-dex/">trade on a DEX</a>, there is no exchange operator, no sign-ups, no identity verification, or withdrawal fees.</p>
<h3>DeFi is like smart money Legos</h3>
<p>With Legos, you start out with a bunch of small bricks. It&#8217;s up to you how you piece together the Lego bricks to build something new. The same is true about smart contracts. With each new project, product, or service launched on Ethereum, you have one more money Lego in your collection. And by piecing together existing components of DeFi, you can combine, modify, or create powerful new finance tools out of these money legos.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-cdai/">cDAI</a> is a perfect example of money Legos in action. <a href="http://compound.finance/">Compound</a> is a money market or, in other words, a lending service on Ethereum. When you supply DAI to Compound, you receive cDAI tokens which represent both your DAI in Compound and any interest you&#8217;ve earned from lending. Since cDAI is a token, you can send, receive, or even use cDAI in other smart contracts. Money Legos in action: ETH into MakerDAO to mint DAI tokens, DAI being supplied to Compound, cDAI tokens can be used in other DApps.</p>
<p>For example, you can <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/best-decentralized-exchanges-dexes/">swap ETH for cDAI on a DEX</a> and instantly start earning interest for just holding cDAI. And because you choose how you interact with smart contracts on the blockchain, you can use a <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/why-dex-ag/">DEX aggregator</a> like <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> to compare and trade at the best prices across all the popular DEXes, all within seconds.</p>
<h3>*Decentralization may vary</h3>
<p>There are varying degrees of decentralization when it comes to DeFi services. Because the truth is, not everything can be or needs to be fully decentralized.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, stablecoins are popular in DeFi. But, not all stablecoins are as decentralized as DAI. Many of them are actually tokens representing fiat currency deposits. For example, for every USDC token, there is 1 USD being held in a bank somewhere. You can theoretically &#8220;tokenize&#8221; or create a token to represent any real world asset. This is where things become a little less black and white, because while you can trade, send, and receive these tokens on the blockchain, you cannot completely eliminate the need to physically manage or redeem the real world asset.</p>
<p>Take for example, purchasing a home on the blockchain. Say someone tokenizes the deed to their home, places it on a decentralized exchange, and you buy it. Without the proper legal setup and the law on your side, you cannot simply force this person from their home regardless if you own the digital version. As it currently stands, you&#8217;d need to fall back on the court system of your home country to settle the dispute.</p>
<p>In short, there are limitations to the technology and sometimes the lines of DeFi begin to blur. In due time, laws will adapt to the changing financial landscape and DeFi&#8217;s place in the world will become clearer. That being said, one thing is clear: DeFi is here to stay.</p>
