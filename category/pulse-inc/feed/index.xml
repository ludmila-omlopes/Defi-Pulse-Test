<p><em>The Flexible Leverage Index (FLI) lets you leverage a collateralized debt position in a safe and efficient way, by abstracting its management into a simple index, reproducible by a fully-collateralized ERC20 token built on Set Protocol.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fli-pulse-1-1024x512.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8980"/></figure>



<p>The Flexible Leverage Index (FLI, pronounced “fly”) lets you <strong><em>leverage</em></strong> a collateralized debt without having to <strong><em>manage</em></strong> a collateralized debt. The design and methodology of FLI allows for the creation of a series of new indices with target leveraged exposure to different collateral assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially <a href="https://pulseinc.medium.com/introducing-the-flexible-leverage-index-5ec90f2381ce">proposed by Pulse Inc in December 2020</a>, we’ve collaborated with Index Coop to produce FLI, an easier way for market participants to utilize leverage. Flexible Leverage Index enables market participants to take on leverage while minimizing the transaction costs and risks associated with maintaining collateralized debt.</p>



<h2><strong>Flexible Leverage Index (FLI) makes leverage effortless</strong></h2>



<p>If you’ve ever used leverage or legacy leveraged tokens, you probably already know how stressful the experience can be. It requires you to constantly be keeping an eye on the market and your position’s health ratio. The worry of liquidation can eat away at your attention during the day and rob you of your sleep at night. Not to mention, the expensive gas fees and slippage when you race to panic buy stablecoins to save yourself from liquidation penalties. It’s never a pleasant experience and in the end you’re left with the thought, “There has to be a better way!” And you aren’t wrong…<br><br><strong>FLI has several key advantages over Legacy Leveraged Tokens:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Zero slippage via composable entry and exit.</li><li>Unique Index algorithm reduces rebalancing needs by an order of magnitude.</li><li>Emergency deleveraging possible during Black Swan events for additional fund safety.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>The Ethereum Flexible Leverage Index</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/fli">The Ethereum Flexible Leverage Index (ETH2x-FLI)</a>, the first index in the Flexible Leverage Index series, provides decentralized target leveraged exposure to Ethereum (ETH). Built on Set Protocol, ETH2x-FLI is the first fully-collateralized leverage token which is redeemable for its underlying components: ETH and USDC. WBTC, LINK, and YFI are other potential candidates which we may consider for the FLI series in the future.</p>



<p><strong>Initial parameters for The Ethereum Flexible Leverage Index:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Underlying Asset: ETH</li><li>Target Leverage Ratio: 2</li><li>DeFi Lending Protocol: Compound</li><li>Maximum Leverage Ratio: 2.3</li><li>Minimum Leverage Ratio: 1.7</li><li>Recentering Speed: 5%</li></ul>



<p>As the first in the FLI series, ETH2x-FLI is the first of its kind on Ethereum: a fully collateralized leverage token, not derivative. It targets 2x leveraged exposure to ETH with a tolerance range to reduce the number of rebalances and thereby increase the gas efficiency for the end user. <a href="http://pulse.inc/flexible-leverage-index">You can view the FLI methodology on Pulse Inc</a>. You can learn more about the technical design of FLI and the mechanics behind leveraged tokens <a href="https://help.tokensets.com/en/collections/2545937-portfolios#leverage-tokens">here</a>.</p>



<p>Historically, leverage has played a big role in the DeFi ecosystem causing moments of extreme volatility which tested the limits of protocols. Aware of this precedent, FLI has been designed to handle volatility and even includes an emergency delevering mechanism for additional safety in the event of a black swan event. FLI’s fully-collateralized and redeemable also helps reduce risk and lends itself well to composability. As an ERC-20, ETH2x-FLI along with other future indices in the FLI series can be integrated into smart contracts for any number of use cases.</p>



<p><a href="http://Pulse.inc/">Pulse Inc</a> is dedicated to creating and maintaining indices for a decentralized world. Flexible Leverage Indices combine unique index algorithm designs with the latest DeFi innovations to provide market participants with a better alternative to the traditional means of taking on leverage. By providing a safer, more efficient leverage product, we hope to spare DeFi users the expense and tolling stress of maintaining leverage and that horrible feeling of getting liquidated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The DeFi Pulse Index is a digital asset index designed to track tokens’ performance within the Decentralized Finance industry. The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. <strong>As part of our </strong><strong>commitment to the ongoing maintenance and development of the DeFi Pulse Index, we are transitioning from v0.1 of our methodology to </strong><a href="https://pulse.inc/"><strong>DeFi Pulse Index Construction, Version 0.2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Version 0.2 introduces a change to the inclusion criteria that tokens must have a circulating supply minimum that is 7.5% or higher to ensure tokens have sufficient liquidity.</p>



<p>As outlined in v0.2 of its methodology, the DeFi Pulse Index is maintained in two phases: the Determination Phase and the Reconstitution Phase. The Determination Phase takes place during the third week of the month. During this phase, the circulating supply of each token currently included in DPI is determined. Any tokens eligible for addition or removal from DPI are also determined during this phase. Finally, new index weights, additions and deletions are incorporated into the index during the monthly Reconstitution Phase on the first business day of the month.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/07lr3Mkjtia8YKBoRCK7EuNm-z7c1LeZGef7gYtaGwHPVUu08o8uVwLrzN18lpvzIQWp96t-vQXeD3qjAU-05oo4M17GzpHOdR6Ja6dMtmGZurhwFiUXP9hhIHFLhjsp4q7H__0c" alt=""/></figure>



<p>DeFi tokens require adequate liquidity to be included in DPI. During our assessment, we found REP to have inconsistent liquidity. Liquidity is fractured across REP V1 and V2. As part of this month’s maintenance of DPI, REP will be removed from the DeFi Pulse Index as it does not meet the liquidity requirements for inclusion at this time. For information regarding inclusion criteria, see <a href="https://pulse.inc/">the DeFi Pulse Index Construction, Version 0.2.</a></p>



<p>In addition to the removal of REP, DPI has decreased its weighted allocations in MKR, YFI, KNC, REN, and LRC. DPI has increased its weighted allocation of COMP, SNX, AAVE, and BAL. <strong>DPI will be rebalanced as part of the Reconstitution Phase on December 1, 2020.</strong> You can also view more information about DPI and its underlying tokens on <a href="https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi">here</a>.</p>

<p><em><em>DeFi Pulse Index is a capitalization weighted index built on Set Protocol’s new V2 infrastructure consisting of 10 of the most popular DeFi tokens available on Ethereum.</em></em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/dpi"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/09/dpi-banner-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8560"/></a></figure>



<p>DeFi Pulse has always been proud to be many user’s first steps into DeFi. It often starts with a google search or tweet which leads you down a long, exciting and sometimes treacherous path of learning the ins and outs of the world of decentralized finance. For some, this path is simply too much; there are so many concepts, terms, and protocols to learn that it can be far too easy to hit a wall or stumble along the path. New users want a safe and reliable shortcut into DeFi that they feel safe placing their trust in. <em><a href="https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi">The DeFi Pulse Index</a> is a blockchain financial product that lowers the barrier to entry for new users who lack the expertise to gain exposure to DeFi, and provides experienced users with exposure to DeFi through one single asset.</em></p>



<h2>A new DeFi standard the community can stand behind</h2>



<p>DeFi Pulse Index is the first of its kind, an index of decentralized finance that isn’t synthetic or a derivative but rather you own the tokens that comprise the capitalization weighted index. Built on Set Protocol’s new v2 infrastructure, DeFi Pulse Index tokens are directly redeemable for its DeFi tokens. Much like our Total Value Locked (TVL) metrics, DeFi Pulse Index is a standard the community can stand behind. Total Value Locked was created to help the community interpret the value locked within the DeFi ecosystem. We see DeFi Pulse Index as a natural progression of what we have to offer to the wider community.</p>



<h2><strong>What was the inclusion criteria for DeFi Pulse Index?</strong></h2>



<p>The index’s criteria to determine which DeFi tokens are included takes into account many factors. The index utilizes a capitalization weighted index where the value weight is based on a DeFi project’s market cap.</p>



<p>As previously mentioned, DeFi Pulse Index’s goal is to establish a standard that empowers the reputable DeFi projects that make up our community. And so, tokens and their dApps are required to embrace common security and decentralization standards.</p>



<p>As such, any included token and its associated dApp and founding team must be widely considered legitimate. It goes without saying that qualifying tokens and their dApps must follow best practices concerning the security and safety of the protocol and post-incident management.</p>



<p>In order to qualify, tokens must be related to DeFi and be bearer assets listed on Ethereum. Tokens held by the index may not be wrapped or synthetic tokens nor can they represent options, futures, physical world assets, or claims to other tokens on blockchains other than Ethereum. Additionally, projects associated with included tokens must be listed on DeFi Pulse and must be launched and functional for a minimum period of time before it may be included in the index. Additionally, the token must have a minimum circulating supply as well as a reasonably predictable total supply.</p>



<p><strong>See <a href="https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi">here </a>for more information regarding the DeFi Pulse Index Construction</strong>.</p>



<h4>What is the initial weighting criteria?</h4>



<p>The index utilizes a capitalization weighted index where the value weight is based off of a DeFi projects market cap. The price per token and circulating supply were taken on September 8th, 2020 from <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en">CoinGecko</a>. Then, the price per token was multiplied by the circulating supply to determine the circulating market cap. Each position is weighted by its relative circulating market cap to other positions in the index.&nbsp; The following tokens are included in the index at launch:</p>



<ul><li>YFI</li><li>LEND</li><li>SNX</li><li>COMP</li><li>MKR</li><li>LRC</li><li>REN</li><li>KNC</li><li>BAL</li><li>REPv2</li></ul>



<h2>Money Legos work better together</h2>



<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that nearly all the projects and protocols behind the tokens included in the DeFi Pulse Index interact in some way or another. This entire industry was built through collaborative innovation with each new protocol and smart contract system, or <em>money lego</em>, building on the next. We have plans to onboard further integration partners (wallets, DeFi dashboards, CEXs etc) over time to broaden access to the DeFi Pulse Index and its underlying tokens. The smooth experience of one-click exposure to 10 of DeFi&#8217;s top tokens is a vast improvement over having to perform 10 transactions or more and truly makes you feel like you&#8217;re living in the future.</p>
