										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) took over the world in 2021. While some people still can&#8217;t fully grasp their value proposition, they are an obsession for many others. Artists, collectors and investors have found fertile ground in the blockchain space, where they can trade and speculate on the price of intangible assets. And more importantly, do it seamlessly without auctioneers or any other middlemen. This is where <a href="https://defipulse.com/dodo">DODO</a>’s brand new feature allowing users to fractionalize NFTs called <a href="http://dodonft.io/">DODO NFT</a> comes in. With DODO NFTs, everyone is able to participate in the NFTs ecosystem by leveraging DODO’s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dodo-and-proactive-market-making/">Proactive Market Maker</a> (PMM) protocol.</p>



<h2>Why fractionalize NFTs?</h2>



<p>Although the NFTs ecosystem has seen enormous growth and success in the past months, creating a market for NFTs can still be difficult for many creators. Since NFTs are non-divisible by definition, their price discovery process is hard; ask and bid prices on NFTs usually have huge discrepancies and the most wanted items have prohibitive prices for the small investors and collectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way to overcome the hurdle of price discovery is with DODO’s approach to the concept of fractionalizing NFTs, which can give rise to a highly active and efficient secondary market. In DODO’s proposed mechanism, an NFT or a collection of NFTs are placed in a vault contract and then fragmented into sub-units by issuing ERC20 (fungible tokens) that represent the ownership of the vault. With this process, anyone can buy a fraction or share of an NFT, regardless of the amount of capital they can invest.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jZP26I8hJDnvCEPmyR7hOnuwyZa5nKjXtEay_MFp4xIlp8zD45R-TvmDSEQr-pMCPaNCMyabEdaleujeIkk4yeY6mLGgSR2IqNLWmIIKV8wCmJDVeklpjd_cDgfzsAqPiwh3hF3H" alt="The fractionalization process using DODO"/><figcaption>The fractionalization process using DODO</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Owning an NFT collectively can be very appealing. The power of community ownership comes from an alignment of values and vision surpasses the amount of interest and money one individual can have. Fractionalizing an NFT collectible can also be powerful from a distribution point of view since, as more people own an NFT the more it signals the value of it to the community.<br></p>



<h2>Create flexible NFT markets with DODO’s PMM</h2>



<p>With DODO NFT, powered by DODO’s established Proactive Market Maker (PMM), creators can easily fractionalize NFTs and bootstrap a market with interconnected liquidity. DODO NFT’s complete suite of tools allows anyone to handle all the processes related to fragmentation, from the vault creation, the ERC20 tokens issuance, the contracts and the creation of dedicated DODO PMMs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO NFT represents a brand-new solution to pricing and liquidity formation of an NFT marketplace. To begin with, the vault contract can hold various assets, including one or more NFTs or a combination of selected ERC20 tokens, serving as an individual or an organization&#8217;s portfolio. Creators of DODO NFT Vaults can also choose to issue a predetermined amount of fungible tokens and select how many will be assigned to the team and how many will go directly to provide liquidity for the PMM.</p>



<h2>What is different from a traditional AMM pool?</h2>



<p>Suppose you issued a certain amount of tokens for an NFT community sale. Automated market makers that use a constant product approach, such as Uniswap V2, require initial liquidity to be deposited in order to set the initial price of the asset. If you want to create a liquidity market for all tokens, you will need to provide an equal amount of money as the bid-side liquidity to achieve the desired initial price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO proactive markets allow you to provide single-sided liquidity. You can build a DODO NFT market and proactively set the starting price for a fragmented token without committing any capital. As traders buy the fungible tokens, the price will automatically increase following a curve. One other crucial contrast to automated market makers that use a constant product approach is that, in the former, only a single price curve is supported, while in the case of DODO PMM, it allows you to set a Slippage Coefficient (k) that gives the flexibility to handle different markets situations.<br><br>Below we can observe different price curves that can be set up with DODO PMM. The simplest one is when k=0. In this curve, the price doesn&#8217;t change with the amount sold. Any token will always be sold for the same price. In the opposite spectrum, k=1, the price increases with the amount sold in the same behavior as the constant product function. It&#8217;s possible to set more smooth curves choosing intermediary values for k. DODO PMM pools also allow for the customization of the trading fees collected from buyers rather than a fixed 0.3% fee.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dodo-Curves-1024x446.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9228"/><figcaption>NFT PMM price curves with different “Slippage Coefficient” k.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Splitting up the DODO NFT Vault into fungible tokens can lead to a powerful mechanism as it allows composability to many other DeFi protocols. The underlying tokens can then be accessed using different DEXes and trading routes to be exchanged with any other token. They could even possibly be used as collateral for borrowing other assets like say for derivatives trading or even as a part of an NFT index primitive.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Learn more about DODO</h1>



<p>DODO NFT is a novel protocol specially designed for innovation and liquidity. It will be launched in June of this year, giving everyone access to the NFTs market. DODO also has many more solutions to different market strategies. You can learn more by <a href="https://dodoex.io/">exploring DODO</a>, following <a href="https://twitter.com/BreederDodo">DODO on Twitter</a>, and joining in the discussion happening in the DODO community on <a href="https://t.me/dodoex_official">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/invite/sWKnV6fRqm">Discord</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A vampire attack or “vampire mining” is a new term in DeFi popularized by SushiSwap’s aggressive migration incentives designed to pull liquidity from Uniswap.</p>



<p>The strategy involves forking an already successful open-source fee-generating protocol, and where opportunities exist, making slight adjustments to better incentivize participants in the new protocol, encouraging the migration of already existing liquidity for essentially the same purpose.</p>



<p><a href="https://uniswap.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwwOz6BRCgARIsAKEG4FVDaI7egyJ4cGSoT7Uc8xLy8Yfd-NFBh3AH8PXuhEGcW3H3pTkesjQaAiAPEALw_wcB">Uniswap</a> made a prime target as it was one of the largest decentralised protocols not to have some sort of governance token or fee distribution token at the time. Uniswap liquidity providers currently share 0.3% fees on all trades made within pools they have provided liquidity to, however the protocol has a <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2/">lever</a> that can be pulled that redirects 0.05% (16.7%) of this 0.3% fee into a funding pool supposedly for ecosystem development, though there are concerns from some members of the community that this would likely just line the pockets of Uniswap’s VCs instead.</p>



<p>Thus <a href="https://sushiswapclassic.org/">SushiSwap</a> was born, an almost direct clone of Uniswap except with an additional protocol related token SUSHI. SUSHI acts as both a governance token and a yield token- always sharing between its holders the 0.05% of fees on trades that Uniswap can divert by activating its lever.</p>



<p>This change also allows prior liquidity providers to continue to earn fees from the protocol even after withdrawing their liquidity from the SUSHI tokens they’ve earned- strongly rewarding early participants with the aim to bolster its community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SushiSwap’s “attack,” as some would call it, hinged on the fact that liquidity providers get Uniswap LP tokens for depositing liquidity in Uniswap’s pool- redeemable for their share of the pool at any time.</p>



<p>SushiSwap capitalised on this by offering staking contracts where Uniswap LP tokens could be deposited to earn SUSHI tokens. The idea was to have a 2-week early distribution at an enhanced rate where 1000 SUSHI were split between stakers per block to attract a lot of LP tokens, before SushiSwap would mass migrate a tonne of Uniswap’s liquidity into its own pools by redeeming the staked Uniswap LP tokens and swapping staker’s Uniswap LP tokens 1 for 1 with SushiSwap SLP tokens, making them whole again in SushiSwap’s new pools. Trading would then begin and the protocol would continue to emit SUSHI to active liquidity providers at 10% of the early distribution rate.</p>



<p>SushiSwap’s staking contracts and SUSHI distribution began on August 28th, causing a parabolic rise from about $280m to $1.8B of total value locked (TVL) in Uniswap over 11 days, before the migration occurred a couple of days early on September 8th, causing about $800m of liquidity to be instantly drained to SushiSwap, with Uniswap’s TVL plunging back to ~$400m.</p>



<p>Interestingly, this is still higher than Uniswap’s TVL prior to SushiSwap. So despite concerns that SushiSwap could have spelled the end for Uniswap, the whole debacle still seems to have been of net benefit to the protocol.</p>



<p>Another point of debate was whether liquidity providers would remain with SushiSwap once the post-migration rewards fell to 100 SUSHI per block or correct back to the more trusted and time-tested Uniswap.</p>



<p>Whilst the initial distribution was going on, Chef Nomi (SushiSwap’s anonymous founder) withdrew the entirety of the dev pool- $7m of eth and ~2.5m SUSHI which they sold for ~$6m of Eth on Saturday 5th, making away with around $13m of ETH profit despite early promises not to, causing SUSHI to decline in price and leaving the community in doubt of the future. Chef Nomi however pledged to continue to support the project’s development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nFBb9rskxUfBDSK1cJAwaIY7KrYSY2PwNqUUfn4wOTUJ_Hlxie6OCnT1dxIB6Aoq0-Yu01xPABTLPXvs-pQ9wZbAHJHC0X2audCV1IbSbu6dkpwuaLj691e4DAzbwpcUyKnwYqxM" alt=""/></figure>



<p>A day later they rescinded his commitment and gave control of SushiSwap to the CEO of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>



<p>&nbsp;In a final twist, Chef Nomi returned all ~$14m of ETH back to SushiSwap’s treasury on September 11th.</p>



<p>Since then, the community has successfully migrated liquidity to SushiSwap and continued forward with the project, though with everything going on SUSHI has unsurprisingly seen some significant price volatility.</p>



<h3>Is this the start of a trend?</h3>



<p>SushiSwap’s aggressive liquidity migration from Uniswap might have been the first significant example of a “vampire attack”, but it bears considering it will probably not be the last.</p>



<p>Any protocol where capital is free to leave easily and can be better incentivized to perform a similar function in another protocol is at risk. In particular protocols that are “simpler” in functionality and that rely more on their own smart contracts and platform to provide their service over being highly integrated with other projects (possessing stronger network effects) are at higher risk.</p>



<p>Uniswap made such a great target precisely because copying the project is largely as simple as copying its smart contracts, and the main requirement for a successful liquidity platform is sufficient liquidity, which as this whole saga has shown can clearly be (at least temporarily) incentivized.</p>



<p>All done and said, it&#8217;s definitely going to be interesting to watch how SushiSwap and Uniswap continue to co-exist (or not) over the next few months.</p>

<p><em><strong>TLDR: </strong><a href="https://docs.dex.ag/proxy-contract">Integrating DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster with custom fees</a> into your platform provides your users or smart contract with convenient native liquidity while allowing you to build a sustainable business model.</em></p>



<h2>Liquidity is vital for the growth of DeFi</h2>



<p>Users want to experience all DeFi has to offer. But often times to do that you  need to swap between tokens or stablecoins. Liquidity is an important resource that enables DeFi&#8217;s composability and makes it possible for many DApps to function. It&#8217;s the blood that flows through the veins of DeFi. </p>



<p>For a smooth user experience, it&#8217;s essential to have a reliable liquidity at a decent price. DEXes are an obvious choice for reliable liquidity when designing an application or smart contract. However, relying on a single DEX comes with its disadvantages. For example, maybe the token your users want to trade isn&#8217;t listed or has extremely low liquidity causing costly price slippage. </p>



<h3>DeFi is all about having options</h3>



<p>If one DEX isn&#8217;t ideal, The obvious answer is to do what DeFi does best with money legos and combine the awesome powers of DEXes. That&#8217;s why we built our other service DEX.AG, a DEX aggregator. DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster let&#8217;s you trade multiple DEXes and even splits trades across the combination of DEXes that results in the best price. Each DEX has its strengths, the X Blaster combines those strengths and connects users with the DEX or DEXes that best suits their needs. Not to mention, the X Blaster&#8217;s API has a blazing fast response time that delivers available trades within a fraction of a second so users never wait.</p>



<h4>X Blaster <strong>aggregates liquidity from popular DEXes: </strong></h4>



<ul><li>0x v3</li><li>Bancor</li><li>Curve</li><li>Kyber</li><li>Oasis</li><li>Uniswap</li><li>Synthetix<br>&#8230;. and more</li></ul>



<p>With each new update, new tokens, exchanges, and integrations like Compound cTokens and CHAI are added to the X Blaster. We focus on token listings and improving your integrated X Blaster so you can focus on what matters.</p>



<h2>Custom fees enable flexible and sustainable business models</h2>



<p>We built DEX.AG because we understand the power of bringing the community together and the value that can create. We see our proxy contracts with custom fees as an opportunity for teams build sustainable models and grow their communities.</p>



<p>We know how crucial the right business model can be to finding the perfect product-market fit. You choose the custom fees on your X Blaster proxy contract. Developers know their users best and this gives them the flexibility to grow their community on their terms. </p>



<h2>X Blaster in action</h2>

<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I learned Bitcoin back in 2013 when I was working for JD.com as a senior engineering director. Later I quit JD.com and built a centralized exchange in China, which listed BTC, Ripple, and some other cryptocurrencies. The multiple hacks of exchanges during 2014 &#8211; 2017 made me think about what technicalities can be used to create a better kind of crypto exchanges that can offer much higher security for user assets. </p>



<p>When Ethereum came out, we formed a team to verify a straightforward idea: using smart-contract to build an exchange to trade tokens. We believe a well audited smart-contract exchange should offer the same level of security as the assets. That&#8217;s the beginning of Loopring, but the project ends up with a very different technical solution that we have never imagined.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>Loopring, in its latest version (3.0), is the first zkRollup-based exchange protocol that can settle more than 2K trades per second without sacrificing the layer1 security and incurs less than 200USD per million settlements. We have just started to operate an exchange built on top of this protocol &#8211; the Loopring Exchange, aka Loopring.io. </p>



<p>However, this is not the end of the protocol or the exchange. We are working on versions that will offer better support for onchain composability and easier customization. With the new version, multiple exchanges built on top of the same protocol may have very different DeFi properties and business models. We believe zkRollup is the right solution for scalability, not just for exchanges, but many dApps that are designed to target millions of active users.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>We target people who use centralized exchanges. As of now, DeFi&#8217;s active user base is still very small, and DeFi onboarding is quite challenging for users without a technical background. With our new smart wallet app (launching later this year), we hope to offer a mobile platform for a massive user base with a language they speak and a set of features they can quickly understand. Eventually, security will be part of the minimum requirement a crypto platform shall offer, not a feature that we now talk about so often.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>Loopring 3.5 is something we look forward to, and it will be code-complete very soon. We also expect Loopring Wallet to make a difference in terms of user acquisition.</p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>Orderbook-based exchanges are essential infrastructures for cryptocurrencies, and they fulfill user needs and will remain the dominant form of trading for the massive, even in the future. We believe Loopring is on the right track, and with continuous optimizations and improvements, we will remain competitive and gradually eliminate the centralized exchange technical stack.</p>



<h3>What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>Serious investors should be concerned with DeFi&#8217;s ever-growing complexity and composability. Our crypto-assets on these products are only as secure as the weakest link in the stack. I do not participate in DeFi aggressively as the return doesn&#8217;t justify the risk for the asset I put in. I&#8217;m not saying we should not participate in DeFi at all, but a wise thing to do is only to invest want we can afford to lose.</p>

<p><strong><em>Loi Luu, Co-Founder and CEO of Kyber Network, spoke with us about his past and the fantastic world of money legos.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>Since I was young I have been interested in programming, particularly in algorithms and data structure. This made me eventually decide to start my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at Vietnam National University in Hanoi and subsequently pursue my PhD at the National University of Singapore. While in Singapore, I came to learn about blockchain technology. My founders and I were amazed at how game-changing blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies were with regards to revolutionizing global payments and transparent finance. </p>



<p>Initially, we worked on the 3 pillars of blockchain technology, namely security (Oyente), decentralization (Smartpool), and scalability (Elastico). The inspiration for Kyber Network came when a project approached us to discuss if it was possible to accept a different token in addition to Ether, with the intention to have common token-holders and community with the other token ecosystem. We were surprised at how hard this seemingly simple problem was. Even for one single cross-token transaction, there were a multitude of problems, ranging from incompatibility (token is different from Ether), finality of the payment (how to check if payment is confirmed), price feeds and so on. This problem gets exacerbated when you have to account for the hundreds of tokens in existence. There was no solution then that addressed this problem in a secure and fully on-chain manner. Our goal, since then, was to facilitate seamless decentralized exchange between different projects and ecosystems. That we thought, might eventually lead to equalizing access to everyone, regardless of origin, location, power or background. </p>



<p>Hence, we developed Kyber Network &#8211; an on-chain protocol for decentralized token exchange in any application. Besides removing key hurdles that hinder the adoption of decentralized technologies, it would give token holders equal access to DApps and services, regardless of which token they hold.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>We are building Kyber Network, a fully on-chain liquidity protocol that enables decentralized exchange of cryptocurrencies in any application, without a need for any intermediary. Since liquidity in the decentralized space is currently scattered, Kyber integrates liquidity providers (Reserves) into one single endpoint for takers (DApps and end users) to easily access. When a taker requests a trade, the protocol will scan the entire network to find the reserve with the best price and take liquidity from that particular reserve. </p>



<p>Kyber’s fully on-chain design allows for full transparency and verifiability in the matching engine, as well as seamless composability with DApps, all of which are not possible with off-chain or hybrid approaches. The integration of a large variety of liquidity providers also makes Kyber uniquely capable of supporting sophisticated schemes and catering to the various needs of DeFi DApps and financial institutions. Not surprisingly, Kyber is the <a href="https://research.binance.com/analysis/2020-borderless-state-of-defi">most used DeFi protocol in 2019</a>.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>Kyber Network’s protocol is open source and permissionless, and can be used by any developer, whether you are at a beginner or advanced level. As Kyber is mainly based on Ethereum, developers should ideally have some knowledge of Solidity. You should use Kyber if you are a developer building any kind of DeFi DApp on Ethereum that involves ERC20 token swaps, payments, liquidation, or rebalancing. For KyberSwap, our in-house token swap service, and one of almost 100 DApps using Kyber Network, our ideal customer is an end user that wants to trade and manage ETH and Ethereum tokens in the easiest and most secure way possible.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>We’re excited about our <a href="https://blog.kyber.network/katalyst-kyber-protocol-upgrade-and-2020-plans-20427ef47ac6">upcoming Katalyst protocol upgrade</a>, which includes the launch of the KyberDAO and a new KNC token model. Katalyst will bring more benefits for stakeholders and DeFi. For instance, reserves will no longer need to hold a KNC balance for fees, removing a major friction point, and there will be rebates for top performing reserves. In addition, integrated DApps can set their own custom fees and create innovative business models, while KNC holders can stake their KNC in the KyberDAO to participate in governance and receive rewards. This is the first time the KNC community will have the ability to vote on key parameters that affect the direction of the Kyber protocol. Katalyst will establish a long term virtuous loop where the success of the DeFi space, growth of the Kyber ecosystem, and value creation for KNC holders go hand in hand.</p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>Kyber aims to be the liquidity layer for the DeFi ecosystem, empowering takers and DApps with a single on-chain endpoint for their liquidity needs and ensuring they receive the best possible rates for each trade. Developers can focus on building and shipping, without needing to worry about liquidity or integrating multiple systems. In general, any DApp that requires on-chain token swaps and is building on DeFi should integrate <a href="https://developer.kyber.network/docs/Start/">Kyber</a> for their liquidity needs!</p>



<h3>What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>One of the great features of Ethereum open source projects is the concept of composability, where different protocols can be integrated and combined with each other like money legos to create new innovative DeFi use cases. We are very excited about the endless possibilities for value creation and we aim to be the single on-chain endpoint required for the liquidity needs of these use cases. </p>



<p>Some of the interesting DeFi use cases include lending platforms such as Fulcrum and Nuo, asset management protocol Melon, Token Sets by Set protocol, and DEX aggregators like <a href="http://dex.ag/">DEX.ag</a> and 1inch. All these platforms utilize Kyber’s on-chain protocol for their liquidity needs. Other popular use cases to pay attention to are Flash loans by Aave, Synthetic assets pegged to public stocks and commodities by Synthetix, DeFi insurance by Nexus Mutual, and Real-time money streams by Sablier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been an amazing year for Decentralized Finance. As of writing this, DeFi has grown from $293M to $665M since the start of 2019. Not only should the community celebrate the tremendous growth this year, but also the many brighter days ahead. Let&#8217;s look to what the future holds for DeFi with four trends you should keep your eyes out for in 2020.</p>
<h3>Privacy Solutions and Mixers</h3>
<p>Research into zero knowledge proof technology was extremely fruitful in 2019. For starters, the gas cost of ZK-SNARKs has greatly been <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-ethereums-istanbul-network-upgrade-affects-defi/">reduced through new EIPs</a>. Not to mention, new ZK proving systems like PLONK, Sonic, etc. are faster than ever. Additionally, EY has continued its work on zero knowledge transaction batching, achieving a 400-fold improvement in gas efficiency.</p>
<p>Aside from the admirable research completed in 2019, many prominent privacy solutions, especially those utilizing ZK-SNARKs, launched new contracts and upgrades onto the mainnet. As with most new technology, testing and audits were necessary for these projects to gain public confidence. For example, Tornado Cash, an ETH mixer using ZK-SNARKs, just <a href="https://twitter.com/TornadoCash/status/1204745639759884289">passed a security audit</a>. Not to mention, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-ethereums-istanbul-network-upgrade-affects-defi/">Istanbul</a> enabled DeFi smart contracts that are interoperable with Zcash. With the steps taken in 2019,&nbsp;expect mixers and other privacy solutions to continue to gain traction in 2020.</p>
<h3>Layer 2 Economics</h3>
<p>Many layer 2 solutions require users to stake or put down a bond for the opportunity to earn protocol fees from layer 2 transactions. Let&#8217;s take a look at <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/what-is-optimistic-rollup-ethereums-latest-layer-2-scaling-solution/">Optimistic rollup</a>&nbsp;as an example which requires bonded aggregators to bundle user-submitted transactions into rollup blocks submitted on their layer 2 sidechains. Users pay aggregators fees to submit their transactions and the new sidechain state root (AKA the optimistic rollup block) to the mainnet.</p>
<p>Anyone can become an aggregator by putting down a bond. Also, anyone can collect rewards for slashing aggregators who submit or build on invalid rollup blocks. We&#8217;re likely to see more solutions like rollups to be deployed in 2020 due to their scaling advantages. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how the economics behind staking and bonded aggregator mechanics shake out in the year ahead.</p>
<h3>DEXes and DeFi Grow Together Challenging Centralized Exchanges</h3>
<p>In 2020, DEXes will grow as more people are drawn to the unique opportunities available in DeFi. Increasingly efficient non-custodial financial tools will continue to attract more traders away from centralized exchanges. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that most activity in decentralized finance requires liquidity to function.&nbsp;More users, more liquidity necessary to operate. For example, margin trading on <a href="https://defipulse.com/bzx">Fulcrum</a> involves swapping between multiple tokens.</p>
<p>Therefore, incentivizing external and native liquidity is key for DeFi platforms. DEX aggregators like DEX.AG offer users an efficient way to access both, promoting decentralization. A prime example of this is the recent integration of Synthetix&#8217;s native exchange into DEX aggregator&nbsp;<a href="https://dex.ag/susd">DEX.AG</a>. Users of both platforms benefit from the additional liquidity and SNX holders collect more native exchange fees. So keep your eyes on how the relationship between DEXes and DApps evolves in 2020.</p>
<h3>Discovery Period for Staking</h3>
<p>Ethereum 2.0&#8217;s set to launch in early 2020. And so, ETH holders will be able to stake 32 ETH and earn fees for validating blocks. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see how many DeFi users will stake. And based on that, what will the returns be like? How will staking influence the greater DeFi community?</p>
<p>What will be the most popular way to stake ETH and cryptocurrency in general? Exchanges and custody services are already offering Tezos staking and will likely offer custodial ETH staking.</p>
<p>What kind of DeFi products and services will launch to suit the needs of ETH 2.0? For example, <a href="https://www.rocketpool.net/">Rocket Pool</a>&nbsp;is arguably the most popular decentralized staking pool in development. Learn more about the changes coming soon with Ethereum 2.0 <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/#phase-0-beacon-chain">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is changing the way people interact with their money.  However, we know it can be a lot to take in. Don&#8217;t worry, because we&#8217;ve put together this quick guide to give you jump start.</p>
<h2>Start making money on DeFi in 4 steps</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with Ethereum, these steps will only take a few minutes. And when it&#8217;s all said and done, you&#8217;ll be earning interest in DAI every block. <em><strong>However if you&#8217;re completely new to Ethereum,</strong></em> you may instead want to check out <strong><a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/zero-to-defi-cdai/">Zero to DeFi</a></strong>, a beginner&#8217;s guide which breaks down the entire process of getting a wallet, acquiring ETH, and lending out your DAI.</p>
<h3>1. Get ETH into an address that you own</h3>
<p>As the saying goes, if you don&#8217;t hold the private keys to the wallet, then they aren&#8217;t your coins. So, be sure to perform these steps from a wallet that you hold the private keys to. And, don&#8217;t forget to keep them backed up somewhere safe.</p>
<h3>2. Head to <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> and sell most of that ETH for DAI</h3>
<p><a href="http://DEX.AG/">DEX.AG</a> is a decentralized exchange or DEX aggregator that gets you the best price available from several of the most popular DEXes. It even splits your trade across multiple DEXes if it improves the price, all in one transaction. <strong>Make sure to leave a little ETH leftover for <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/what-is-gas/">gas fees</a>.</strong></p>
<h3><a href="https://dex.ag/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7722" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300.jpg 1000w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></h3>
<h3>3. Go to DeFi Pulse&#8217;s <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">Earn Income page</a></h3>
<p>DeFi Pulse is a site where you can find the latest analytics and rankings of DeFi protocols. The DeFi Pulse <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">Earn Income page</a> compares the interest rates you can earn from DeFi lending protocols.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/income"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7715" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-260x300.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="693" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-260x300.jpg 260w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-886x1024.jpg 886w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-768x887.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295.jpg 934w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h3>4. Pick a lending protocol, and start earning interest</h3>
<p>Enter the asset and amount you wish to lend to find which lending protocol has the best interest rate. Pick a protocol and click the &#8216;Next&#8217; button which will redirect you to that app/service. Compound finance is currently the most popular lending protocol. Follow the app&#8217;s instructions to begin lending out your DAI and start earning interest.</p>
<h3>And then later, when you&#8217;re ready to cash out&#8230;</h3>
<p>Head back to the lending protocol you chose and use your private key to unlock the DAI plus interest generated whenever you want. There&#8217;s no &#8220;lock-in&#8221; period or time you have to wait before earning interest. Your DAI is earning interest every block until you choose to stop.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DeFi is an abbreviation of the phrase <strong>decentralized finance</strong> which generally refers to the digital assets and financial smart contracts, protocols, and decentralized applications (DApps) built on Ethereum. In simpler terms, it&#8217;s financial software built on the blockchain that can be pieced together like Money Legos.</p>
<p>To get a feel for the products and services that exist in the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem, you can check out our <a href="https://defipulse.com/">DeFi rankings</a> which tracks the current value locked into popular DeFi smart contracts.</p>
<p>Computers have disrupted nearly every industry over the years. Each innovation builds on the previous one, and digital products and services become more sophisticated. Through technology, we&#8217;ve catered the world to fit our needs. From digital assistants to home automation, programs now affect many aspects of your daily life. So why would money be any different?</p>
<h2>What is decentralized finance and who is it for?</h2>
<p>To better understand DeFi, we should first take a look at how traditional finance came about. Although it sometimes feels like money has always been around, that&#8217;s simply not the case.</p>
<p>Humans originally bartered for the goods and services. But as human societies formed and developed, so did our economies. We invented currency to make exchanging things of value easier. Subsequently, currency helped usher in new innovations and higher levels of economic productivity. However, progress didn&#8217;t come without its cost.</p>
<p>Historically, central authorities such as governments have issued the currencies that underpin our economies. Central banks and institutions were expected to carefully manage and regulate the supply of currency in circulation. As the size and complexity of our economies grew, these central authorities gained more power as more people placed trust in them.</p>
<p>You trust your government to not print more money overnight. You trust your bank to safely store your money. And, when it comes to investing, you trust your assets to a financial adviser. By handing control of your money over to others, you hope to earn a profit. But the sad truth about our current financial system is that the power that comes along with this trust isn&#8217;t always rewarded.</p>
<p>We often have very little say in how corporations handle our investments, or even how our governments manage the economy. And in most cases, investors only receive a fraction of the returns generated from the risks taken by these central authorities.</p>
<h4>DeFi is trying to build something different</h4>
<p>Decentralized finance aims to create a financial system that&#8217;s open to everyone and minimizes one&#8217;s need to trust and rely on central authorities. Technologies like the internet, cryptography, and blockchain give us the tools to collectively build and control a financial system without the need for central authorities.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a saying in the blockchain space: &#8220;Don&#8217;t trust, verify.&#8221; Because with a blockchain network, you as an individual can verify any and every transaction that occurs on the blockchain.</p>
<h3>DeFi allows everyone to take charge of their financial well-being</h3>
<p>Almost all DeFi applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain, the world&#8217;s most popular programmable blockchain. Ethereum is a blockchain network that maintains a shared ledger of digital value. Instead of a central authority, the participants that comprise the network control the issuance of ether (ETH), the network’s native cryptocurrency, in a decentralized manner.</p>
<p>Developers can program applications on Ethereum that can create, store, and manage digital assets, also called tokens, on the blockchain. These are called <strong>smart contracts </strong>or <strong>decentralized applications (DApps)</strong>. They’re contracts or agreements enforced by the Ethereum blockchain. Or rather, applications or scripts that run only as programmed on the Ethereum network. You can build complex irreversible agreements without the need for a middle man.</p>
<p>Decentralized finance has the opportunity to bring about a more resilient and transparent financial system. Anyone with an internet connection is able to access and interact with smart contracts built on the Ethereum blockchain. Many smart contracts are built to be open-source and interoperable with existing smart contracts. So, users can verify the smart contracts&#8217; code and choose which services work best for them.</p>
<h4>What are some examples of popular DeFi applications?</h4>
<p>There are <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-on-ethereum/">many different DeFi products and services</a>, some of which you may find familiar to existing financial services but with a decentralized twist.</p>
<p>Arguably, the most popular and fasting growing sector of DeFi is borrowing and lending platforms. Similar to a bank, users deposit money and earn interest from other users borrowing their assets. However, in this case the assets are digital and smart contracts connect the lenders to borrowers, enforce the terms of the loans, and distribute the interest. And it all happens without the need to trust one another or middleman bank. And, by cutting out the middleman, lenders can <a href="https://www.defipulse.com/income">earn higher returns</a> and more clearly understand the risks thanks to the transparency blockchain provides.</p>
<p>Tokens called stablecoins are also important to the DeFi ecosystem. You may be under the impression that all cryptocurrency is volatile. However, stablecoins are tokens designed to hold a specific value and are typically pegged to fiat currency like the US dollar. For example, DAI is a stablecoin pegged to USD and backed by ether (ETH). For every DAI, there is $1.50 of ETH locked into the <a href="http://makerdao.com/">MakerDAO</a> smart contract as collateral.</p>
<p>Another type of popular DeFi application is what&#8217;s called a <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange/">decentralized exchange</a>, or DEX for short. DEXes are cryptocurrency exchanges that use smart contracts to enforce the trading rules, execute trades, and securely handle funds when necessary. When you <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-to-trade-on-a-dex/">trade on a DEX</a>, there is no exchange operator, no sign-ups, no identity verification, or withdrawal fees.</p>
<h3>DeFi is like smart money Legos</h3>
<p>With Legos, you start out with a bunch of small bricks. It&#8217;s up to you how you piece together the Lego bricks to build something new. The same is true about smart contracts. With each new project, product, or service launched on Ethereum, you have one more money Lego in your collection. And by piecing together existing components of DeFi, you can combine, modify, or create powerful new finance tools out of these money legos.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-cdai/">cDAI</a> is a perfect example of money Legos in action. <a href="http://compound.finance/">Compound</a> is a money market or, in other words, a lending service on Ethereum. When you supply DAI to Compound, you receive cDAI tokens which represent both your DAI in Compound and any interest you&#8217;ve earned from lending. Since cDAI is a token, you can send, receive, or even use cDAI in other smart contracts. Money Legos in action: ETH into MakerDAO to mint DAI tokens, DAI being supplied to Compound, cDAI tokens can be used in other DApps.</p>
<p>For example, you can <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/best-decentralized-exchanges-dexes/">swap ETH for cDAI on a DEX</a> and instantly start earning interest for just holding cDAI. And because you choose how you interact with smart contracts on the blockchain, you can use a <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/why-dex-ag/">DEX aggregator</a> like <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> to compare and trade at the best prices across all the popular DEXes, all within seconds.</p>
<h3>*Decentralization may vary</h3>
<p>There are varying degrees of decentralization when it comes to DeFi services. Because the truth is, not everything can be or needs to be fully decentralized.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, stablecoins are popular in DeFi. But, not all stablecoins are as decentralized as DAI. Many of them are actually tokens representing fiat currency deposits. For example, for every USDC token, there is 1 USD being held in a bank somewhere. You can theoretically &#8220;tokenize&#8221; or create a token to represent any real world asset. This is where things become a little less black and white, because while you can trade, send, and receive these tokens on the blockchain, you cannot completely eliminate the need to physically manage or redeem the real world asset.</p>
<p>Take for example, purchasing a home on the blockchain. Say someone tokenizes the deed to their home, places it on a decentralized exchange, and you buy it. Without the proper legal setup and the law on your side, you cannot simply force this person from their home regardless if you own the digital version. As it currently stands, you&#8217;d need to fall back on the court system of your home country to settle the dispute.</p>
<p>In short, there are limitations to the technology and sometimes the lines of DeFi begin to blur. In due time, laws will adapt to the changing financial landscape and DeFi&#8217;s place in the world will become clearer. That being said, one thing is clear: DeFi is here to stay.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past, users had to rely on centralized exchanges to trade their cryptocurrency. But, things have come a long way since then and you have other options. And, nowadays decentralized exchanges provide users with a competitive alternative.</p>
<h3>Not sure what decentralized exchanges are?</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s okay if you&#8217;re unfamilar with what decentralized exchanges are. Here&#8217;s a helpful explainer you can read to learn <a href="/blog/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange/">what a DEX is</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got a grasp of the basics, let&#8217;s move onto a few examples. We&#8217;ve put together a list of some innovative and popular DEXes that people like to use in the Ethereum community.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7455 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></h3>
<h3>Uniswap</h3>
<p>Funded by an Ethereum Foundation grant and launched in November 2018, Uniswap is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges and is known for its wide selection of trading pairs. Uniswap&#8217;s code is open source and it has no investor tokens.</p>
<p>Uniswap&#8217;s smart contract let&#8217;s you swap ETH or ERC-20 tokens on-chain by pooling liquidity. Each swap is charged a 0.03% liquidity fee which is added to the pool incentivizing users to contribute equal parts ETH and ERC-20.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7457 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></h3>
<h3>KyberSwap</h3>
<p>KyberSwap&#8217;s a DEX that allows users to swap tokens, powered by the Kyber Network. Kyber Network, a liquidity protocol which aggregates liquidity reserves, held an ICO for its KNC token in late Q3 2017. Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) tokens have a variety of uses on the Kyber Network.</p>
<p>For example, each swap performed on the Kyber Network require the fees to be paid in KNC which is then burned. Paying your fees in KNC gives you a discount. Otherwise, the smart contract swaps part of your payment for the KNC to pay the fee. KNC&#8217;s also needed to open your own liquidity reserve to earn on the Kyber Network.</p>
<p>KyberSwap recently added the option to place limit order trades. No deposit is required and you receive a 50% discount on the 0.1% fee when you pay in KNC.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7456 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/radarrelaylogo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/radarrelaylogo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/radarrelaylogo.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></h3>
<h3>Radar Relay</h3>
<p>Radar Relay is the most popular 0x protocol relayer. With the 0x trading protocol, users submit signed trade order. Users&#8217; orders are kept in orderbooks off-chain and eventually all trades settle on-chain.</p>
<p>Those who keep orderbooks are called relayers because they relay signed orders off-chain. When the order is taken off the book, the other party signs the pre-signed order transaction. And then, the transaction&#8217;s submitted and the funds transfer from their wallets.</p>
<p>And, one of the best parts is that there are no sign-ups, deposits, and currently no fees. Radar Relay offers an experience more reminiscent of traditional exchanges. There&#8217;s no fees to place limit orders; Only trades that take orders off the books, or taker orders.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7176 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo-150x150.jpg" alt="Dex.Ag" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<h3>DEX.AG</h3>
<p><a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> is a free site that searches over 10 of the most popular DEXes for the best price, saving you time and money. Instead of having to run around to each individual site, DEX.AG scans Uniswap, Kyberswap, Radar Relay, Eth2Dai, and loads more DEXes for the best price for your trade.</p>
<p>Simply, enter the token and quantity of what you&#8217;re looking to buy or sell and DEX.AG finds you the best deal. And if you hit the &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; button, DEX.AG will walk you through completing your trade via MetaMask or your web3 browser wallet.</p>
<p>And best of all, you and your trade are interacting directly with the DEX&#8217;s smart contract. So, there are no additional fees on top of fee of your selected exchange.</p>
<h3>Thanks for reading</h3>
