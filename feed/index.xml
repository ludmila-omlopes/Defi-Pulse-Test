										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Users from around the world should be able to easily access the benefits of decentralized finance. Yet in DeFi’s early days, you could really only be initiated to these benefits by manually figuring things out on your own through trial and error. This has kept accessibility at bay in kind!&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s needed, then, is an advanced DeFi transaction builder made simple &#8211; a system where anyone can readily manage a range of different activities, from yield farming to leveraged positions and debt refinancing, from a single dashboard and regardless of skill level. Stepping up to the plate here is DeFi management solution <a href="https://bit.ly/34TuwmX"><strong>DeFi Saver</strong></a>, which just launched the beginnings of such a system via its new powerful <em>Recipe Creator</em> feature. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://bit.ly/34TuwmX"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KN58a0-eduwIKya0Q6ED80owTuiUvM12iaewWfFkfE_2N0R7JGb-bMNvryr5349sctQAiwoI8SWHrdnTLW1Y2Tt46pMtfiedWHj6fAu7fNXoDbfMd7m1OTCz33Qlgg6J-ZeiZw_I" alt=""/></a></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cooking up all things DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>The <strong>Recipe Creator</strong> is a transaction builder interface for creating and executing <em>recipes</em>. Simply put, recipes are blends of DeFi activities that can involve interactions between multiple DeFi apps and additionally utilize flashloans and token swaps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <strong>flashloan</strong> lets users borrow large amounts of crypto <em>without collateral</em> so long as the debt is paid back within the same transaction but, previously, flashloans were mostly isolated to the domain of DeFi experts. That’s all changing now that <strong>the Recipe Creator is letting anyone easily use these powerful tools</strong> to streamline multiple DeFi actions into single transactions, all through DeFi Saver’s audited, reputable, and user-friendly infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://bit.ly/3vZU0el"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--jdU88PMEzy-iT1u8Sc0mHiW21LsZ_nrQlYzEDltwQqiouuIFmq116rjbRJV8grBBzmQBz3FHzAD2TVZnvVG8bK9bVLg2oxsxo1hJSG2fDiTtrN7xd3hvQgCVxCEGUxugjeUYJY" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>The Recipe Creator itself is currently divided into two main parts: the <a href="https://bit.ly/3vZU0el">Recipe Book</a>, which is composed of pre-made recipes or rather pre-structured DeFi strategies, and the eponymous <a href="https://bit.ly/3g1pL1j">Recipe Creator</a>, which allows builders to <strong>simply drag-and-drop their own recipes together</strong> however they please. </p>



<p>Additionally, the Recipe Creator makes use of natural language processing, so users can just write simple instructions like “Supply 500 DAI to Compound” or sequences of instructions separated by commas to quickly create recipes. Recipes currently support actions across top DeFi apps like <strong>Aave, Compound, Maker, Reflexer, and Uniswap V2</strong>, and the DeFi Saver team plans to integrate new protocols regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ease of these future integrations will come courtesy of DeFi Saver’s recently overhauled smart contract system, which now composes transactions efficiently as mixtures of composable activities rather than one long string of stacked actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result is an <strong>optimized transaction builder</strong> system that lets users conveniently manage a range of staple DeFi activities, like borrowing, lending, creating and managing leveraged positions, and yield farming. And if you&#8217;re creating a collateralized debt position in order to obtain stablecoins or other assets for liquidity farming purposes, note that DeFi Saver also has liquidation protection options in the form of their Automation features.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Simulate recipes before you try them</strong></h2>



<p>DeFi Saver notably released a new <strong>Simulation mode</strong> feature alongside the Recipe Creator. This mode lets you quickly spin up a simulated 100 ETH account and then experiment with executing recipes and more with this simulated ETH in any way you see fit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accordingly, gone are the days where users must use <em>actual ETH</em> on the Ethereum mainnet to first get the hang of DeFi activities. Instead, when activated <strong>Simulation mode forks at the current Ethereum block</strong> so you can freely play around with market conditions, e.g. prices, as they existed upon activation. This gas-less environment is perfect for helping novices and veterans alike practice and strategize their DeFi activities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3vARUuaRvmMdANfwH6iyHoXHxSubL1O_oUOJ6Ig4e5Zc6jHnlyyscW1HY820cEiFWI9vnDSLZwtnNaWk5QUVE5uozCYsRT-X55AYcTi__KCFcrkyHg86im1GkPscSi6lZBR0jf5p" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>If you’re interested in starting a Simulation account on DeFi Saver and taking some recipes for a spin, simply <strong>click on the “Simulation” button on the lower left-hand corner of the DeFi Saver dashboard</strong>. Upon doing so, select whether you want to create a new simulated account with 100 play ETH or to simulate your current account as it exists at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Don’t sleep on the Recipe Creator</strong></h2>



<p>As it currently stands, the Recipe Creator already has the potential to bring in more than a few new DeFi users by making the UX around using DeFi so streamlined and convenient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the DeFi Saver team wants to improve this UX even further with more additions and advancements. For starters, new integrations with DApps like Lido, Liquity, and Yearn are on the slate for the near future as are integrations with promising layer-two (L2) scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync 2.0. The DeFi Saver team is also exploring the automation of recipes, so consider keeping an eye out for that as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are interested in tracking the progress of the Recipe Creator going forward, you can stay up to date on all current happenings by following DeFi Saver on <a href="https://bit.ly/34VQnKF">Twitter</a> or by joining the project’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/XGDJHhZ">Discord</a> community. </p>



<p><em>Disclosure: This post is part of our paid promotional DeFi Pulse Drops series; We’ve partnered with DeFi Saver to help educate and inform the community about its new Recipe Creator technology. As always, we’re committed to providing the entire community with quality, objective information, and any opinions we express are our own.</em></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Welcome back! This week be had the opportunity to chat with Preston Van Loon, Co-Founder of <a href="https://defipulse.com/cryptex">Cryptex</a>, who offered up lessons he&#8217;s learned building in the cryptocurrency space and what excites him about DeFi.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><a href="https://cryptex.finance/">Cryptex</a>’s flagship product is TCAP, which is the Total Crypto Market Cap token. This is a synthetic collateralized asset. The price of TCAP directly correlates with the total market cap value of all cryptocurrencies in the space. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We think this is a really unique product in that there&#8217;s not really a great way for retail investors or any kind of investor to buy into the entire market. Maybe they think that cryptocurrencies in general are a good thing and going in the right direction, but they may not really have the ability to analyze and understand all the protocols, either a technical level or a user level. But they know that cryptocurrency is the future. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So with something like TCAP, they&#8217;re able to get exposure to the entire market and be able to capture the value of cryptocurrencies from an investment perspective.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So, the scalability trilemma is this famous problem where you have these three properties to the blockchain, and you want to be able to increase any aspect of that trilemma without taking away from something else. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">That being said,<strong> you want it to be secure, fast and decentralized.</strong> And so you can go fast if you take away the decentralized aspect of it, maybe you&#8217;re running like the super node. Or you could go fast by making it cheaper to do and not verifying signatures or really just making it less secure in that way if you go faster. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>I think that scalability is the problem that we need to solve, and most urgently.</strong> I think that the other two aspects, decentralization and security are also important, security being the most important, I think, in terms of a blockchain where there will always be some aspects of centralization. And that&#8217;s fine to some extent. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We always want to make it as decentralized as possible, but security being number one, if you violate the security assumptions of a blockchain, it&#8217;s no longer secured, it&#8217;s game over or could be game over essentially. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">And then scalability coming second, it&#8217;s like, you want it to go fast without really taking away from too much of the other aspects.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>In order to have a long lasting community, you need to keep the community engaged. </strong>You know, we&#8217;re building this together, <strong>it&#8217;s not just the Cryptex team building out cool, exciting products. We&#8217;re building it together as a community.</strong> </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">And it&#8217;s still initially by the Cryptex team, but going forward it&#8217;s built by the community almost in every aspect we could think of. Community members are hired to the Cryptex DAO, continuing development and outreach and these kinds of things. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">On an ongoing basis, we have meetings with the community, kind of bringing everybody together, figuring out how the DAO should operate and what the next steps should be. Either on the forums and our discord channel or on a frequent Zoom call that we have every other week.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>I think that DeFi is really not getting the full attention that it should.</strong> The thing that <strong>I&#8217;m most excited about with DeFi is this concept of being your own bank.</strong> And that&#8217;s sort of something that we strive to do with blockchains in general.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">But in terms of really just earning interest with your capital, with your savings in traditional finance, it&#8217;s not very rewarding to do that, but in a DeFi space, you kind of take out the middleman there, being the brick and mortar banks who are making money off of you. You could be making that money yourself in DeFi space, there are a lot of really creative products out there. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Something upcoming that I think is really cool is <a href="https://element.fi/">Element Finance</a>, it&#8217;s built by some of the people who&#8217;ve done a lot of really exciting work on the Ethereum protocol. And this project in particular helps users basically earn interest on their ether without sacrificing or locking up the principal or the full principal for the entire time. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So it&#8217;s a really interesting project in that way, that you&#8217;re able to deposit the ether. Then you can sell off your principal and just earn the interest that you would have at the end of the maturity of the contract.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">There&#8217;s a lot of lessons that I have learned. I&#8217;ve been working on blockchain stuff for about three years, a little more, and it&#8217;s a very different world from traditional software development. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So from the development perspective, it&#8217;s all about really making sure that things behave the way you expect them to. Getting there takes lots of vigorous testing being, unit testing at the code level, and testing it, on some sort of testnet or simulation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">And then of course there&#8217;s a lot of testing around the usability of things. Actually getting in there and playing with it, not just on an automated level, but really being careful about, and putting a lot of thought into the design is important because once you&#8217;ve deployed it, it can be difficult to upgrade it or modify it any way. So if you release it with a bug, you may be stuck with a bug forever. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>The lesson is: you got to really plan things out and move carefully, it&#8217;s the opposite of move fast and break things. </strong>It&#8217;s move slow and make sure you did it all right so you don&#8217;t get stuck or have to do it again.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I&#8217;m a big fan of the ultrasound money meme. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-1024x573.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-9386" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-1024x573.jpeg 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-300x168.jpeg 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-768x430.jpeg 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-1536x860.jpeg 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-2048x1147.jpeg 2048w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ultrasoundmoney-585x328.jpeg 585w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Basically, it&#8217;s kind of a meme for Bitcoiners where they say that Bitcoin is sound money, mostly due to the fixed supply cap. And with Ethereum&#8217;s new monetary policy coming out towards end of the year, it becomes instead of an inflationary asset, it becomes deflationary. And so the meme&#8217;s argument is that if a fixed supply is sound money, then a deflationary supply is even more sound. And that next level of sound money is ultrasound money. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So I liked that meme, you can see it in a lot of Ethereum, Twitter names and profiles that have the bat and the speaker that&#8217;s ultrasound meme. And I&#8217;m really a big fan of that because it kind of brings light to these two different types of monetary policy between Ethereum and Bitcoin.</p>

<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>The pleasure is all ours. Hamzah is Head of DeFi at Polygon for those who may be unfamiliar.</em></p>



<p><em>Let&#8217;s dive right into the questions:</em> <strong>Can you give a brief intro to Polygon (formerly Matic Network) for the audience?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong> Polygon is an Ethereum scaling solution with a suite of projects including the Plasma and PoS chain. Ton of DeFi, NFT and Gaming activites happening on all and we are happy to scale ETH with our unique, battle tested and production ready chains.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Polygon has become very popular indeed.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Community members wanted to know: </em><strong>What’s the difference between Proof of Stake (PoS) Bridge and the Plasma Bridge?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah: </strong>Definitely &#8211; PoS and Plasma are different security standards that support different assets right now. PoS &#8211; Proof of Stake validated by our 100 validators currently on ETH mainnet which share (not completely) its security. Plasma is another L2 scaling solution popular back in 2018, also supports MATIC tokens (because they were the first ones on the chain) and has 7 days withdrawl time (trx finality) &#8211; inherits completely from ETH&#8217;s security.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Thanks for that thorough answer. You actually touched on a question we received on Twitter this week:</em> <strong>Why might a DApp prefer a sidechain over a standalone rollup solution?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong>&nbsp; Definitely happy to provide more clarity on this, I have multiple reasons &#8211;</p>



<p>1. Battle tested &#8211; Polygon PoS and Plasma chains have been production ready for more than a year with increasing decentralization and optimizations in checkpointing to ETH whilst maintaining a decent UX in exit times. Gratefully we havent seen any malcious activity or failure of the network till now. The community completely understands the EVM friendly nature of the chain and can quickly deploy (unlike porting period of months on some other solutons).</p>



<p>2. Spectrum of decentralization &#8211; Our PoS commit chain is not the most decentralized solution out there and we are aware of it. To improve on this front we have increased validators from 80 to 100 in less than 2 months and continuing to do so more in the future. On the decntrlzn spectrum, we are in between rollups and pure sidechains, but this solution is live and moving closely towards gradual decentralization like addition of multisigs and eventual timelock governance</p>



<p>3. gas fees &#8211; Community IMO is overestimating the gas fees reduction on some of these rollups. They are significantly centralized on the L2 side as some of them will start with a single operator and no clear roadmap to decentralize. On the gas fees because they send all trxs to ETH mainnet and pushing proofs on-chain will congest ETH more and the gas fees on these L2s will atleast be single digit dollars if not more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is fine for &#8220;whales&#8221; and &#8220;shrimps&#8221; but not the retail that #DeFiForAll Polygon is trying to include. So we are very well positioned in that sense not just for DeFi but others too.</p>



<p>I hope that answers a few of the doubts.&nbsp;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>You make excellent points regarding Matic Network, its history, and more importantly where it is headed.</em></p>



<p><em>I for one was excited to see the </em><a href="https://blog.polygon.technology/announcing-polygon-sdk-the-gateway-to-multi-chain-ethereum-8ad580ec387"><em>Polygon SDK announcement</em></a><em> earlier this week.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Speaking of the future&#8230;. </em><strong>What will the competitive landscape for scaling solution protocols look like in the future &#8211; let&#8217;s say 5 years (e.g. consolidation or growth)? </strong><em>Though feel free to adjust the time frame as you see fit.</em></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong> I think it&#8217;s super growth time for L2s as that&#8217;s the way DeFi scales to a million users. We believe it won&#8217;t be a winner takes all market &#8211; Ethereum hosts a vast variety of applications and application specific L2 solutions might also come up, and that would be very interesting. As a matter of fact, SDK caters exactly that avenue.</p>



<p><strong>CS: Can you elaborate a bit on what the SDK means for Polygon and the wider ecosystem?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong> It means Ethereum can finally be a multi-chain system &#8211; in an increasingly fragmented space it will become hard to scale on specific L2s. Polygon with the suite of shared security and standalone chains brings a modularity that we have seen by AWS in Web2. Projects can use OR, ZK, Standalone or even Enterprise solution chains as per their use case.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>That&#8217;s really cool sounding. We’re running a bit short on time, but I believe we have time for one more question.</em></p>



<p><strong>What area or solution that is not currently being worked on do you Hamzah think is the most important for the Ethereum ecosystem?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong> Learning from other L1s and incorporating some of their best practices. Ethereum became what it is today by challenging the status quo of Bitcoin community. But if we remain maximalists in this sense and not willing to adapt it will become difficult for us to compete with other L1s in the not-so-distant future.</p>



<p>Not sure if the community will hate me for saying this or not, but yeah my 2 cents. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f61b.png" alt="😛" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>I think anyone can appreciate honesty. Especially if it comes with good intentions.</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you for making time in your busy schedule to be with us.</em> <strong>Do you have any else you’d like to share before we wrap things up?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hamzah:</strong> Nope, thanks a ton for having me.&nbsp;<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Well thanks again for coming Hamzah. We know you have to go, but we appreciate you coming today</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There’s a new automated market maker (AMM) on the block, and it has the infrastructure to shake things up in DeFi. The protocol’s tech, which allows the decentralized exchange to feast on the liquidity of other exchanges, is uniquely advantageous for liquidity providers (LPs), so now the race is on to see how many users the project can win over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DEX in question? <a href="https://integral.link/deposit"><strong>Integral</strong></a>, a new kind of trading protocol that launched in March 2021 and whose team is positioning it to compete with both <em>decentralized </em>crypto exchanges like Uniswap and <em>centralized </em>crypto exchanges like Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>An AMM to Eat All AMMs?</strong></h2>



<p>To compete with the exchanges of the world, Integral needs a compelling way to match these exchanges’ liquidity. So what’s one protocol to do against the combined activity of all these other bustling entities?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eIf2Og4K3j8nNVFL5nJ8Qrc3yjSNhKclKz4MAbECv8qCK547sIaNWCiMagEqyYCMJ-TOXTIUy8TOnYTvUoZPim0CkNq-4NfTbj1Q4Fy4vNr_74rQREUgKhNZj_Sgici290erSZAr" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Fortunately for Integral the protocol has an interesting answer, a <strong>new AMM style called an Orderbook AMM, or OB-AMM</strong>. What’s special about this style is it allows Integral to “mirror” its competitors’ external liquidity at will, yet with the major advantage of needing just a <em>fraction </em>of that liquidity in the project’s own pools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is because of how the OB-AMM model achieves what’s known as <strong>concentrated liquidity</strong>, i.e. liquidity that’s distributed along a price range, upon which capital can be condensed in particular places. Integral delivers LPs and traders concentrated liquidity by <strong>decoupling </strong><strong><em>capital</em></strong><strong>, the crypto in the OB-AMM’s pools, from </strong><strong><em>depth</em></strong>, as in an orderbook’s depth or the shapes of pools’ price ranges. The project notably offered this advantage weeks ahead of Uniswap V3, which launched in May 2021 and has since helped popularize concentrated liquidity.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RcOO6tBh5Dq_0_A6E-4QRLO50f1VzBRTUnwmqmiI8d8VuGR1Ecy3THlraM8riVlqNcPkYtO7zz6iUIR-ZrgUMG4XFfeArIDzi1ryi_Wp2IE3vE_OhTG6BslLo2Yt5-mtIp6VO0lH" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Accordingly, Integral can match the world’s exchanges by taking <em>their </em>orderbooks and mirroring <em>their </em>depth onto Integral’s own pools. This is why Integral currently enjoys +$11B in implied liquidity and same-level price impact while simultaneously having only ~$111.5M in <a href="https://defipulse.com/integral">total value locked (TVL)</a> at the moment. It can provide 3x the depth of Binance’s orderbook, for example, and it needs way less liquidity to do so. The ensuing efficiency helps keep price impact lower and LP APYs higher for users.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Impermanent Profit (IP) is here to stay</strong></h2>



<p>There are two other foundational elements of Integral that make the AMM innovative: the protocol’s <strong>trade delay</strong> system and its <strong>mean-0 impermanent loss</strong> (IL) system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Integral’s <em>trade delay</em> forces traders to wait 5 minutes + Ethereum’s confirmation time, an implementation that protects LPs from the threat of (IL) caused by arbitrageurs and frontrunners. And <em>mean-0 IL</em> entails Integral LPs having IL profiles that oscillate around 0. At times this IL will even become negative, meaning it becomes more profitable to supply an asset to a pool in contrast to just holding it in your wallet, and over time the IL will converge to 0.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The combination of these systems with Integral’s overall efficiency has led to pronounced occasions of what the project’s team is calling <strong><em>impermanent profit</em></strong><strong> </strong>(IP<strong>)</strong>. Again, if IL means you would’ve been better off holding your assets than LPing them, <em>IP</em> means you ended up better off LPing than you would have by just holding the underlying assets.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tQ3lQMssk8fCt8YGcx0J__JNKosMufKdj9x6GDPoHYzd4DGESJGM7NxD51pGlB2yMDcdIyw0dGVlQc5px-pYVPUt9972rehX2gijQE3JwOswIUfMOguhnwvCUGp8oumyX9VRqwJf" alt=""/></figure>



<p>For instance, LPs of Integral’s ETH-USDT pool saw <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ/status/1396128896542597121">0.5% impermanent profit</a> within the <em>first week</em> of the AMM opening up trading to the public. Of course there are no guarantees for how anything will perform over time, but Integral’s efficiencies mean there’s undoubtedly more such profits where those came from for the project’s LPs going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>ITGR pre-farming continues</strong></h2>



<p>This coming June 7th, Integral’s token genesis event (TGE) will take place for the project’s native ITGR token. </p>



<p>In the meantime, you can already start accruing ITGR rewards by providing liquidity for, or trading through, the AMM’s pools: ETH-WBTC, ETH-DAI, ETH-USDC, ETH-USDT, ETH-LINK, and the project’s newly launched stable pools, <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ/status/1397608962724294658">DAI-USDC, DAI-USDT, and USDC-USDT</a>. With its concentrated liquidity feature, these new pools are designed to deliver the same stablecoin depth and slippage as some of the biggest pools in DeFi, all while leading the industry in stablecoin trading fee levels at 2 bps. </p>



<h2><strong>Keep an eye on Integral</strong></h2>



<p>Integral is all but poised to grow from here, as the protocol’s ability to mirror competitors’s liquidity makes its potential considerable. At the same time the project is still young and has plenty of work on its roadmap, so there’s lots more to track from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can give <a href="https://integral.link/swap">Integral’s trading pools</a> a try for yourself when you next have the chance, and if you’re wanting to learn more about this game-changing decentralized exchange then you can stay up to speed by following Integral on <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ">Twitter</a> or by participating in Integral’s communities on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/GJYCF55Tb6">Discord</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Uma-header.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9335" width="1024" height="512"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In this installment, we sat down with Clayton Roche, Community Lead at UMA and Co-founder of the DeFi Nation group, who offers a unique perspective on the trials of building a new industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’ll be precise with my answer and list a few things that set UMA apart. UMA’s contracts are self-contained, so any issue with one collateral type will not affect neighboring contracts. UMA allows for any collateral type, as opposed to requiring the use of our own token. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">UMA also has its own oracle solution, which is not the case for similar products, and this solution operates unlike any other currently live. It is a “priceless” system whereby the prices come on chain very infrequently and only ever due to a dispute.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Security is really first and foremost.<strong> Scalability without security just means losing people&#8217;s money more efficiently.</strong> </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Decentralization is a certain type of security, but must come after actual smart contract security and effective financial engineering.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The most critical part? I would say,<strong> finding scalable ways to recognize when people bring value</strong>. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, if someone creates a dashboard or meme or shares an interesting idea, finding ways to recognize their contribution. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">This can be done in many ways. Sometimes that means rewarding them with ownership in a protocol they are helping to build, and other times that means integrating their suggestion.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">&#8220;Real-world&#8221; integrations. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think DeFi has gotten very self-referential but that will all fall away after the bull market.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Everyone feels like they have imposter syndrome. And how could we not? </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We’re literally designing a new industry—Even if someone tells you you’re great, who qualified them to make that judgement? </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I’ve learned to let my passion and intellectual interest distract me from my own insecurities, and that usually keeps me going through the day.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>

<p>Previously, providing liquidity to automated market maker (AMM) projects in DeFi has been a manual and somewhat tedious process. You source the required amount of tokens for your desired pair, approve token contracts, pay gas fees to deposit, and then if you’re looking to farm further yields you might go and stake your new liquidity provider (LP) tokens, which takes yet another transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You go through all these steps only to endure the risk of impermanent loss (IL) while you serve as an LP. Now, though, <em>it is</em> possible to provide liquidity and earn DeFi yields simply and without the risk of IL. That’s because <a href="https://impermax.finance/"><strong>Impermax</strong></a>, a decentralized marketplace for borrowing and lending LP tokens, is offering a game-changing new way to participate in LPing called <em>Indirect Liquidity Providing</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uqVZj40ev81y7CVPscU_0BVsVbfsJJdOBw4VjUjsn0FlIU629FU_0Xnxwji7vd5dEYl2qaZZDIR_l1n-QHD0xv5zWwFbETl4airftBWwWfbQF-iVk3VMoZFQHmnrTNA_r6ThM_Ui" alt=""/></figure>



<h2><strong>A new way to LP in DeFi</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Indirect Liquidity Providing</strong>, a novel way to participate in DeFi liquidity markets, involves earning yield by <em>lending </em>assets to other LP token holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="http://defipulse.com/impermax">Impermax</a> system this works through the protocol’s lending pools, which use LP tokens like ETH-DAI Uniswap V2 LP tokens as collateral. These pools only allow borrowing and lending around a given pool’s token pair, such as ETH and/or DAI if you’re borrowing against ETH-DAI UNI-V2 tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accordingly, DeFi users can now supply a <em>single </em>token to an Impermax lending pool to earn yields indirectly through an AMM, all while facing essentially no threat of impermanent loss. This is in stark contrast to the IL risk users take on when they directly serve as LPs!&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://impermax.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="555" height="329" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2z3yCV7xfTT6sA_rTwCtmQN47qNPcMAicueZTYMiZ9_DZP4SQEghbdR73-3fxZvHPL7D7fsnXJdHC6-v0Kx8kU2EKtvRsAkit5QQp6aO0JtDS4YkjtZBE23z9RhMDhPy2KOzLGHc"></a></p>



<p>In this way, we can understand Impermax as an <strong>Indirect Liquidity market</strong>. Users lend their assets to yield farmers, who then convert these assets into further LP tokens in order to boost their own yields. These yield farmers take on all the risk of impermanent loss while paying out a portion of their yields to pay back their loans from Impermax lenders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Yield farming made simple</strong></h2>



<p>A key advantage of the Indirect Liquidity Providing system is that it offers lenders an easy, simplistic avenue for yield farming. This is because Impermax’s lending markets do away with having to go through multiple steps like acquiring LP tokens and thereafter staking them in order to farm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, <strong>lending through Impermax offers a casual, one-step, staking-like process for yield farming</strong>: you deposit a token into your lending pool of choice, and voila, you’re earning yield and can claim it any time. That’s about as simple as it gets when it comes to farming opportunities in DeFi, so these farms also minimize the need for transactions, which can really add up gas-wise with other traditional yield farms!&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi beginners want entry-level yield farms, and DeFi veterans enjoy simple passive earning opportunities, so Indirect Liquidity Providing has a little something for everyone. This will ensure Impermax will continue to have an important role to play in DeFi, as there’s big demand for simple yield farming solutions while many AMMs are becoming increasingly complex, like Uniswap V3.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Good for DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>To compete with traditional finance, DeFi will need to continue being a liquidity blackhole and continue attracting in more money. More money equals more efficiency, and more efficiency means better options for users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, <strong>Impermax’s Indirect Liquidity Providing innovation represents a benefit for all of DeFi</strong>, insofar as this new lending style makes it easier to provide liquidity to AMMs and can thus help these AMMs grow faster than they would have otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In time, then, we might even see some AMM projects incentivize and promote Impermax’s lending markets since these markets can serve as a direct and increasingly important pipeline of activity to them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Learn more about Impermax</strong></h2>



<p>Impermax is a first-of-its-kind protocol for borrowing and lending LP tokens, so be sure to keep the project on your radar as it now works on adding support for LP tokens from Uniswap V3 and other major DeFi trading protocols like Curve and SushiSwap. You can learn more by following Impermax on <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpermaxFinance">Twitter</a> or by joining in on the project’s community discussions on <a href="https://discord.gg/XN739EgG4X">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ImpermaxFinance">Telegram</a>.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another week, another intriguing chat to share with you all. For this week&#8217;s Founder Fireside Chat, we spoke with Ross Middleton, Co-Founder of <a href="https://defipulse.com/deversifi">DeversiFi</a>, about the leap forward in technology that rollups represent for our industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">DeversiFI is a layer-2 exchange built on Ethereum. When we set out 2 years ago, we wanted to give people all the features and benefits that they were used to from trading on a large centralised exchange, but without giving up control of their funds. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We launched on the StarkWare validium technology 10 months ago to launch the first scalable &amp; private DEX that offers incredible aggregated liquidity for major pairs. Trading &amp; Swapping on DeversiFi is private &#8211; privacy and aggregated liquidity are two of the main differentiators vs other order book DEXs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think all three are important aspects. For those who haven&#8217;t encountered DeversiFI before, DeversiFi is a layer-2 exchanges that uses zk rollup/validium technology to achieve scalability without sacrificing security or decentralisation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We examined a number of different scaling solutions (and built one or two ourselves) before landing on zk rollup technology as rollups really do solve the scalability trilemma.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Building a product that people find useful and can actively be a real part of is key in building a long lasting community. <strong>If you give people a unique tool that solves one of their daily pain points then they are only too happy to provide feedback and put their time into making your project even better.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am biased here but Layer-2 really is the future. All of these &#8216;Ethereum killer&#8217; layer-1 chains are having their moment in the sun because fees on Ethereum are so high at the moment. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We have operating Layer-2 exchanges on Ethereum that allow people to trade &amp; swap without paying any gas at all. <strong>Within 12 months we will also start to see Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible rollups, bridges and CEX on/off-boarding. There may never be a reason for anyone to every touch Layer-1 Ethereum ever again, let alone another blockchain.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So many! We launched at the bottom of the bear market in 2020, before DEXs and DeFi was really a thing. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We had an existing DEX that settled every trade on-chain, but it was taking up a lot of time to support and interfered with our ability to raise financing as people thought it was our main product. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In hindsight, we should have stopped supporting our old product and focused entirely on the new one. There are so many other lessons that we have learned as a team but we don&#8217;t have time to go into more than one of two!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I like the &#8216;waiting for Eth 2.0 to launch meme&#8217; the most because <strong>we actually don&#8217;t need Eth 2.0 to fully launch now that we have a whole ecosystem of rollups that is springing up.</strong> I see rollups as a way to scale Ethereum for the long run, not just whilst we are waiting for execution sharding.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Chaz Schmidt:</strong> <em>Hello and welcome @everyone ! Thank you for joining us today for an AMA with Simone Rigolon, Founder of Impermax.</em></p>



<p><em>Simone will be answering questions we&#8217;ve collected from you, the community, throughout the week. Special thanks to everyone who submitted questions for today&#8217;s AMA.</em></p>



<p><em>Thanks for joining us Simone.</em> <strong>How are you today?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone Rigolon</strong>: Hi Chaz and DeFi Pulse community! It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m very good, and you?</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I&#8217;m doing quite well. Thanks for asking.<br><br>To start things off, can you share a little about Impermax for the audience? </em><strong>What is Impermax?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Impermax is a decentralized lending protocol designed around LP tokens.</p>



<p>It allows borrowers to use LP tokens as collateral to take loans. This enables them to enter in leveraged positions on their LP tokens.</p>



<p>On the other hand lenders are able to &#8220;indirectly provide liquidity&#8221; to Automated Market Makers by supplying their tokens to the borrowers. Lenders are able indirectly earn from AMMs trading fees without any exposure to impermanent loss.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Very cool. You touched on a point that piqued the community&#8217;s interest earlier this week on Twitter. </em><strong>Can you explain lndirect Liquidity Providing for those unfamiliar with the concept?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone:<em> </em></strong>Let&#8217;s start from normal liquidity providing which means supplying tokens to an AMM. This can be a very profitable way to invest capital, but at the same time there is the risk of impermanent loss and there are some complexity that are going to get worse with time. Basicallly it is not ideal for the average user.</p>



<p>Indirect liquidity providing means that you can lend your tokens to liquidity providers. They will borrow them and use them to provide liquidity to AMMs and earn trading fees. In return you will get a percentage of the trading fees they earn. This is ideal for the average user because it can be a &#8220;set and forget thing&#8221;, there is no exposure to IL and it requires only a single token.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong><em> Ahh. So for example with for the USDC/ETH LP token pool you could provide USDC and earn trading fees without exposure to impermanent loss?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Exactly <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Browsing through Impermax ahead of the AMA I noticed that LP token lending pools are isolated. </em><strong>What does this mean for Impermax users and what led to the decision to isolate the lending pools?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>There are many reasons that lead to this decision but the main one is that we wanted to build a protocol that was as permissionless as possible. Keeping all lending pools separated means that anyone can create a new one because even a malicious pool wouldn&#8217;t be able to affect negatively all the other existing pools.</p>



<p>The main advantages of this choice are scalability, security and minimized governance.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>That makes sense. Isolating the pools also isolates risk, mitigating any chance of systematic failure from one bad pair.</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Exactly, it&#8217;s an architecture very similar to the one used by Uniswap for pairs.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>So Uniswap pairs are supported by Impermax today and the community wants to know: </em><strong>What AMM LP tokens do you plan to support in the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>The plan is to add support for more AMMs like Uniswap V3, SushiSwap, PancekeSwap and others. Ideally we would want to support as many LP tokens as possible. Luckily our choice of keeping all lending pairs isolated allow us to scale as much as we want since supporting a new LP tokens doesn&#8217;t have any drawback on the existing ones.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I&#8217;m glad you brought up Uniswap V3 because I saw that on your <a href="https://impermax.medium.com/impermax-road-map-e320fdb4652d">roadmap</a> the other day and wondered how that will work with V3&#8217;s new price curve NFT setup. </em><strong>Can you shed any light on that at this time? </strong><em>We will accept soon <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> if necessary</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> I can&#8217;t give too many details on how exactly it will work because we&#8217;re still researching LP NFTs and the way they can be used as collateral. Some complicated math involved, so it&#8217;s hard to talk about that in an AMA. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Personally I&#8217;m very excited about supporting LP NFTs on Impermax because Uniswap V3 is very capital efficient by itself, and with NFTs enabled to be used as collateral that&#8217;s going to improve even more!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>No worries! The audience can stay tuned for that one. We only have a few minutes left anyways.</em></p>



<p><em>Since we&#8217;re on the topic of the roadmap,</em> <strong>what’s coming up on the roadmap that you’re excited about?</strong><br><br><em>Or even a recent release since you mentioned LP NFTs.</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Many things like new features for the existing app, support for Uniswap V3 support for layer 2 and other networks.</p>



<p>I bet users are going to be very happy once Impermax releases on lower fees networks, but personally the thing I&#8217;m most excited about is Uniswap V3 support, for the reasons I&#8217;ve just talked about. Capital efficiency is key for AMMs in the long term and both UniswapV3 and Impermax are solutions to improve it.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>When you put it like that, it&#8217;s easier to see why on your website, you describe Impermax as “The missing piece to the Automated Market Makers&#8217; puzzle”</em></p>



<p><em>In your own words, </em><strong>how does Impermax complement AMMs and where do you see Impermax fitting into the puzzle?</strong><br><br><em>We&#8217;ve reached 30 minutes. Do you have time to answer this and maybe one other question?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Wow time runs fast. Yes, I have have time.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I know right? Awesome I wanted to touch on one other aspect of Impermax that our community was asking about.<br><br>Impermax introduced a liquidity mining program which rewards users with IMX tokens for borrowing on Impermax.</em> <strong>What was the motivation behind incentivizing borrowing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong> The main reason is to incentivize the protocol usage and attract more liquidity. Impermax needs a lot of liquidity in order for the incentives to really work as they should. Farming is always a good way to bootstrap a new protocol.</p>



<p>There are a few reasons why we incentivized only borrowing and not lending. The main one is because lenders are still indirectly rewarded since the borrowing demand is very high. Not giving the reward to lenders means that they don&#8217;t have to worry about claiming it and instead they are rewarded with an higher supply APR that will compound over time.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Interesting. In other words, borrowers pursuing more liquidity mining rewards earn more trading fees for lenders.<br><br>I think that&#8217;s about all the time we have for today. Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to say?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Not really, I just want to thank you and DeFi Pulse for organizing this event. It was a pleasure to answer these questions.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>You&#8217;re welcome as always. Thank you for coming! I learned a thing or two and I&#8217;m sure the audience found it helpful.</em></p>



<p><em>And thank you all for coming to today&#8217;s AMA!</em></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Welcome! We&#8217;re glad to have you back for another Founder Fireside Chat. This week, we sat down with Robert Lauko, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://defipulse.com/liquity">Liquity</a>, whose work aims to push the bounds of decentralization.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In contrast to other stablecoins and CDP platforms, Liquity is optimized for making borrowing as attractive as possible. It achieves this by replacing interest rates with a very low, one-time fee (most of the time only 0.5%) paid upfront on the borrowed amount and by only requiring a collateral ratio of 110%. This makes borrowing LUSD very capital efficient, cheap for medium to long term loans, and particularly interesting for leverage seekers. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Liquity also has a unique approach to handling liquidations. In other systems, under-collateralized positions are usually resolved through lengthy collateral auctions. Liquity replaces these auctions by pooling together capital (i.e. LUSD) upfront from users wishing to buy liquidated collateral effectively at a ~10% discount. We call this mechanism the Stability Pool. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Lastly, as a result of its radical approach to immutability, Liquity is also completely algorithmic, with the system being able to auto-adjust to external circumstances like a peg break.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In a strict sense, <strong>security is the most important since an unsecure system is flawed even if it’s scalable or decentralized, while centralized and unscalable systems can have legitimate use cases. </strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For building a highly dynamic application like Liquity with its redistribution mechanism, we had to go miles to work around Ethereum’s scalability issues. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">On the other hand, we are pushing the concept of decentralization by not running an official frontend and by making the protocol fully immutable. But without being secure, these features would mean nothing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In order to form a lasting community that sticks with your product or service, you need to make sure that you can offer sustainable value in the long run rather than just temporary benefits. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>While yield farming opportunities are great to attract early adopters, it is crucial to keep delivering long term utility regardless of the market conditions. </strong>Furthermore, you need to make sure that your users and community members have easy access to the team and that their questions, concerns, and ideas are heard.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Most of the focus has been on decentralizing the backend, i.e. the smart contracts, while few projects have tried to decentralize their frontends too.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> IPFS and Arweave are interesting in this regard, but they are detached from the platform (e.g. Ethereum) that is hosting the backend. With DFINITY’s Internet Computer, it will become possible to seamlessly decentralize the backend and the frontend using the same technology stack. With their recent launch, they’ll be worth keeping an eye on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Over the last 1.5 years it became clear to me how important it is to build a team that is motivated, shares the same principles, and is aligned with the vision of the project. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>When people are committed to a common goal and working together as a group, they can create incredible results. </strong>Outsourcing tasks to third parties and companies turned out to be much more challenging and less successful in my experience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">DeFi is becoming more and more popular among the real farmers <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> So the farming memes are my favorite.</p>

<p>Did you know that the combination of how the Earth’s gravity warps spacetime and the speed at which a satellite travels effectively allows satellites to time travel into the future nanoseconds at time? If you wanted to time travel, theoretically you’d need two things: a massive black hole and and an incredibly fast spacecraft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many have described DeFi as a liquidity black hole, sucking in anything that comes near it. And now, there’s a craft capable of speeds fast enough to <em>slingshot</em> us into the future. <a href="https://app.slingshot.finance/"><strong>Slingshot</strong></a><strong> is a next generation decentralized trading platform which aggregates the top liquidity sources in order to give traders like you the best prices, speed and execution on trades.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In late February, Slingshot launched its closed beta with a unique way for users to earn their invite. The first 100 players to complete the race, a sci-fi themed browser game, won access to the beta and NFT prizes for having the best speedrun times. One player even finished the race so quickly they were <a href="https://twitter.com/AgentProtocol/status/1365828515489345537">accused of being a robot</a>. While a race may seem odd, it was arguably the perfect primer for the futuristic look and feel of Slingshot’s smooth trading interface.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://slingshot.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="443" height="46" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9291" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo.png 443w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo-300x31.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>You can now try it for yourself today because <a href="https://app.slingshot.finance/"><strong>Slingshot</strong></a><strong> is live on Polygon</strong>. Slingshot chose to launch their first Liquidity Zone on Polygon because it fit with their mission to provide traders with the best trading experience.</p>



<h2>Slingshot is tailored for a next level trading experience</h2>



<p>To quote its early <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1329235851813953537">teaser</a> video, Slingshot wants you to “fall in love with DeFi all over again.” And to be honest, the video game-like UI/UX of Slingshot is rather alluring. Between the live price chart, trade history, scrolling price ticker, and all the flashes of red and green when token prices update, you feel like you’re behind the console of a trading machine.</p>



<p>Speedrunning was indeed an apt way to introduce users to Slingshot, a trading platform built for speed. The flow of trading on Slingshot is rather intuitive. You can either start by searching for a token to trade using the search bar or click the + sign on the left side to bookmark a token. Next, select whether you want to buy or sell and the amount you want to spend. And voila, Slingshot finds you the best price for your trade aggregated from the top liquidity sources.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://app.slingshot.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="506" src="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-1024x506.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9293" srcset="./../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-1024x506.png 1024w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-300x148.png 300w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-768x379.png 768w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-1536x759.png 1536w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-585x289.png 585w, ./../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1.png 1917w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<h3>A polished UI with a buttery smooth trade flow</h3>



<p>When trading bookmarked tokens, this entire process flows smoothly from left to right allowing you to trade incredibly fast, especially on Polygon. While Polygon is the only publicly available Liquidity Zone today, beta users can tell you how awesome it is to seamlessly switch between Liquidity Zones. Slingshot allows you to search for tokens across Liquidity Zones and then filters the list of available tokens according to the Liquidity Zone of the token you selected. So say you’re connected to Ethereum but want to buy MATIC on Polygon. There’s no need to pre-switch your network in Metamask because Slingshot handles this as part of the trade flow. Don’t worry though; you’ll get the chance to see what this is like soon enough.</p>



<p>The more subtle details in the user interface also really add polish to the entire trading experience. For example, when you hover your mouse over the ticker at the top, it feels as if time slows as the scrolling ticker slows in reaction to your cursor. And when you hover over the chart, the cursor becomes a crosshair which follows the line of the price chart. Every little bit adds up to make trading frictionless and fun again.</p>
