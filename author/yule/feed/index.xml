<p>Following its stated goal to establish standards that the community can stand behind, <a href="https://defipulse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi Pulse</a> (through <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pulse.inc/" target="_blank">Pulse Inc</a>) has developed different methodologies to tackle the market&#8217;s increased interest in tokenized indices, which are spreading wildly across DeFi and becoming more and more popular every day.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Today, the second product of the FLI series, <a href="https://pulseinc.medium.com/flexible-leverage-index-btc2x-fli-launch-755605f45468">the Bitcoin Flexible Leverage Index (BTC2x-FLI), was introduced</a>, and we want to expand into how it works and the story of how it was designed.</strong></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="879" height="242" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-16.15.25-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9269" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-16.15.25-1.png 879w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-16.15.25-1-300x83.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-16.15.25-1-768x211.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-16.15.25-1-585x161.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" /></figure>



<h2>Index tokens: what are they?</h2>



<p>Index tokens are similar to TradFi&#8217;s ETFs and ETNs, collective investment funds that seek to track the performance of a benchmark index but offer several advantages over these more traditional instruments, especially for new entrants. Index tokens can also be attractive to passive participants with a lack of time or knowledge of a specific strategy or market.</p>



<p>Besides keeping track of a specific market, index tokens can also represent structured financial products with sophisticated strategies. The <a href="https://www.pulse.inc/flexible-leverage-index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flexible Leverage Index (FLI)</a> is a prime example, tokenizing a collateralized debt position in a single ERC-20 token to allow investors to have leveraged exposure in one click. While users today enjoy the stress-free leverage FLI’s strategy provides, it took several years for the concept of FLI to come to fruition.</p>



<h2>The birth of the FLI methodology</h2>



<p>Ten years before co-founding DeFi Pulse, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-lewis-2a554430/" target="_blank">Scott Lewis</a> used to work for the global trading and technology firm Susquehanna International Group where, as a derivatives trader, he developed the best strategies to find profitable trades. While working there, he first envisioned the design of the FLI methodology, even though TradFi was not fertile ground to quickly develop these kinds of financial products. </p>



<p>In Scott&#8217;s words:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“I was using autoregressive models in some of my derivative tradings, and I realized that an index in which the leverage automatically regressed to a target leverage ratio would greatly reduce the product’s rebalancing needs.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>The usual way to get leverage in the DeFi space is by understanding and executing a complex series of steps. First, investors need to provide collateral to a given protocol and withdraw debt. Afterward, this debt has to be allocated to that same protocol or a different one, and, depending on the strategy and the amount of required leverage, these steps have to be repeated multiple times. Throughout this process, investors need to continuously monitor the market to ensure they don’t get liquidated. The FLI methodology delegates all the above steps to the issuer, offering the investor a leveraged position with targeted exposure to an asset in the form of an ERC-20 token.</p>



<p>The TradFi approach to leveraged ETFs also has other inefficiencies, as Scott’s points out:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Leverage products frequently track an index that returns the exact leverage ratio each 24 hours period. This inflexibility results in some of these products having to buy and sell a significant amount of assets each and every day. All this trading can create bad returns for the users of these products.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Even though the FLI methodology targets a 2x leverage ratio, it uses a tolerance range and an algorithm that reduces rebalancing needs by order of magnitude, thereby increasing the gas efficiency, which translates into direct <strong>savings by the holder</strong>.</p>



<h2>The Bitcoin Flexible Leverage Index (BTC2x-FLI)</h2>



<p><strong>BTC2x-FLI</strong>, released today, targets 2x exposure to WBTC price. That means that its price is expected to fluctuate double that of WBTC on average. In other words, if WBTC rises 10% in price, BTC2x-FLI is designed to go up by 20%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope that <strong>BTC2x-FLI </strong>as an improved solution for DeFi investors is able to fill a niche in the market as large as its predecessor. ETH2x-FLI has seen explosive growth and achieved a market cap of more than $100M just seven weeks after launching.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>From a far-off dream to a powerful tool improving on traditional markets, the emergence of index tokens shows how much the DeFi ecosystem has evolved in the last year and a half. FLI is only possible thanks to a maturing DeFi ecosystem; its sophisticated strategy crafted into a simple user experience stands as a testament to what&#8217;s possible through our collaborative innovation as an industry. This is one of the many reasons why we’re so excited to be launching more indexes in the FLI series.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) took over the world in 2021. While some people still can&#8217;t fully grasp their value proposition, they are an obsession for many others. Artists, collectors and investors have found fertile ground in the blockchain space, where they can trade and speculate on the price of intangible assets. And more importantly, do it seamlessly without auctioneers or any other middlemen. This is where <a href="https://defipulse.com/dodo">DODO</a>’s brand new feature allowing users to fractionalize NFTs called <a href="http://dodonft.io/">DODO NFT</a> comes in. With DODO NFTs, everyone is able to participate in the NFTs ecosystem by leveraging DODO’s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dodo-and-proactive-market-making/">Proactive Market Maker</a> (PMM) protocol.</p>



<h2>Why fractionalize NFTs?</h2>



<p>Although the NFTs ecosystem has seen enormous growth and success in the past months, creating a market for NFTs can still be difficult for many creators. Since NFTs are non-divisible by definition, their price discovery process is hard; ask and bid prices on NFTs usually have huge discrepancies and the most wanted items have prohibitive prices for the small investors and collectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way to overcome the hurdle of price discovery is with DODO’s approach to the concept of fractionalizing NFTs, which can give rise to a highly active and efficient secondary market. In DODO’s proposed mechanism, an NFT or a collection of NFTs are placed in a vault contract and then fragmented into sub-units by issuing ERC20 (fungible tokens) that represent the ownership of the vault. With this process, anyone can buy a fraction or share of an NFT, regardless of the amount of capital they can invest.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jZP26I8hJDnvCEPmyR7hOnuwyZa5nKjXtEay_MFp4xIlp8zD45R-TvmDSEQr-pMCPaNCMyabEdaleujeIkk4yeY6mLGgSR2IqNLWmIIKV8wCmJDVeklpjd_cDgfzsAqPiwh3hF3H" alt="The fractionalization process using DODO"/><figcaption>The fractionalization process using DODO</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Owning an NFT collectively can be very appealing. The power of community ownership comes from an alignment of values and vision surpasses the amount of interest and money one individual can have. Fractionalizing an NFT collectible can also be powerful from a distribution point of view since, as more people own an NFT the more it signals the value of it to the community.<br></p>



<h2>Create flexible NFT markets with DODO’s PMM</h2>



<p>With DODO NFT, powered by DODO’s established Proactive Market Maker (PMM), creators can easily fractionalize NFTs and bootstrap a market with interconnected liquidity. DODO NFT’s complete suite of tools allows anyone to handle all the processes related to fragmentation, from the vault creation, the ERC20 tokens issuance, the contracts and the creation of dedicated DODO PMMs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO NFT represents a brand-new solution to pricing and liquidity formation of an NFT marketplace. To begin with, the vault contract can hold various assets, including one or more NFTs or a combination of selected ERC20 tokens, serving as an individual or an organization&#8217;s portfolio. Creators of DODO NFT Vaults can also choose to issue a predetermined amount of fungible tokens and select how many will be assigned to the team and how many will go directly to provide liquidity for the PMM.</p>



<h2>What is different from a traditional AMM pool?</h2>



<p>Suppose you issued a certain amount of tokens for an NFT community sale. Automated market makers that use a constant product approach, such as Uniswap V2, require initial liquidity to be deposited in order to set the initial price of the asset. If you want to create a liquidity market for all tokens, you will need to provide an equal amount of money as the bid-side liquidity to achieve the desired initial price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO proactive markets allow you to provide single-sided liquidity. You can build a DODO NFT market and proactively set the starting price for a fragmented token without committing any capital. As traders buy the fungible tokens, the price will automatically increase following a curve. One other crucial contrast to automated market makers that use a constant product approach is that, in the former, only a single price curve is supported, while in the case of DODO PMM, it allows you to set a Slippage Coefficient (k) that gives the flexibility to handle different markets situations.<br><br>Below we can observe different price curves that can be set up with DODO PMM. The simplest one is when k=0. In this curve, the price doesn&#8217;t change with the amount sold. Any token will always be sold for the same price. In the opposite spectrum, k=1, the price increases with the amount sold in the same behavior as the constant product function. It&#8217;s possible to set more smooth curves choosing intermediary values for k. DODO PMM pools also allow for the customization of the trading fees collected from buyers rather than a fixed 0.3% fee.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dodo-Curves-1024x446.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9228"/><figcaption>NFT PMM price curves with different “Slippage Coefficient” k.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Splitting up the DODO NFT Vault into fungible tokens can lead to a powerful mechanism as it allows composability to many other DeFi protocols. The underlying tokens can then be accessed using different DEXes and trading routes to be exchanged with any other token. They could even possibly be used as collateral for borrowing other assets like say for derivatives trading or even as a part of an NFT index primitive.&nbsp;</p>
