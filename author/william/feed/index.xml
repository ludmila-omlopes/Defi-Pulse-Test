										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Users from around the world should be able to easily access the benefits of decentralized finance. Yet in DeFi’s early days, you could really only be initiated to these benefits by manually figuring things out on your own through trial and error. This has kept accessibility at bay in kind!&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s needed, then, is an advanced DeFi transaction builder made simple &#8211; a system where anyone can readily manage a range of different activities, from yield farming to leveraged positions and debt refinancing, from a single dashboard and regardless of skill level. Stepping up to the plate here is DeFi management solution <a href="https://bit.ly/34TuwmX"><strong>DeFi Saver</strong></a>, which just launched the beginnings of such a system via its new powerful <em>Recipe Creator</em> feature. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://bit.ly/34TuwmX"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KN58a0-eduwIKya0Q6ED80owTuiUvM12iaewWfFkfE_2N0R7JGb-bMNvryr5349sctQAiwoI8SWHrdnTLW1Y2Tt46pMtfiedWHj6fAu7fNXoDbfMd7m1OTCz33Qlgg6J-ZeiZw_I" alt=""/></a></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cooking up all things DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>The <strong>Recipe Creator</strong> is a transaction builder interface for creating and executing <em>recipes</em>. Simply put, recipes are blends of DeFi activities that can involve interactions between multiple DeFi apps and additionally utilize flashloans and token swaps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <strong>flashloan</strong> lets users borrow large amounts of crypto <em>without collateral</em> so long as the debt is paid back within the same transaction but, previously, flashloans were mostly isolated to the domain of DeFi experts. That’s all changing now that <strong>the Recipe Creator is letting anyone easily use these powerful tools</strong> to streamline multiple DeFi actions into single transactions, all through DeFi Saver’s audited, reputable, and user-friendly infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://bit.ly/3vZU0el"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--jdU88PMEzy-iT1u8Sc0mHiW21LsZ_nrQlYzEDltwQqiouuIFmq116rjbRJV8grBBzmQBz3FHzAD2TVZnvVG8bK9bVLg2oxsxo1hJSG2fDiTtrN7xd3hvQgCVxCEGUxugjeUYJY" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>The Recipe Creator itself is currently divided into two main parts: the <a href="https://bit.ly/3vZU0el">Recipe Book</a>, which is composed of pre-made recipes or rather pre-structured DeFi strategies, and the eponymous <a href="https://bit.ly/3g1pL1j">Recipe Creator</a>, which allows builders to <strong>simply drag-and-drop their own recipes together</strong> however they please. </p>



<p>Additionally, the Recipe Creator makes use of natural language processing, so users can just write simple instructions like “Supply 500 DAI to Compound” or sequences of instructions separated by commas to quickly create recipes. Recipes currently support actions across top DeFi apps like <strong>Aave, Compound, Maker, Reflexer, and Uniswap V2</strong>, and the DeFi Saver team plans to integrate new protocols regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ease of these future integrations will come courtesy of DeFi Saver’s recently overhauled smart contract system, which now composes transactions efficiently as mixtures of composable activities rather than one long string of stacked actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result is an <strong>optimized transaction builder</strong> system that lets users conveniently manage a range of staple DeFi activities, like borrowing, lending, creating and managing leveraged positions, and yield farming. And if you&#8217;re creating a collateralized debt position in order to obtain stablecoins or other assets for liquidity farming purposes, note that DeFi Saver also has liquidation protection options in the form of their Automation features.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Simulate recipes before you try them</strong></h2>



<p>DeFi Saver notably released a new <strong>Simulation mode</strong> feature alongside the Recipe Creator. This mode lets you quickly spin up a simulated 100 ETH account and then experiment with executing recipes and more with this simulated ETH in any way you see fit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accordingly, gone are the days where users must use <em>actual ETH</em> on the Ethereum mainnet to first get the hang of DeFi activities. Instead, when activated <strong>Simulation mode forks at the current Ethereum block</strong> so you can freely play around with market conditions, e.g. prices, as they existed upon activation. This gas-less environment is perfect for helping novices and veterans alike practice and strategize their DeFi activities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3vARUuaRvmMdANfwH6iyHoXHxSubL1O_oUOJ6Ig4e5Zc6jHnlyyscW1HY820cEiFWI9vnDSLZwtnNaWk5QUVE5uozCYsRT-X55AYcTi__KCFcrkyHg86im1GkPscSi6lZBR0jf5p" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>If you’re interested in starting a Simulation account on DeFi Saver and taking some recipes for a spin, simply <strong>click on the “Simulation” button on the lower left-hand corner of the DeFi Saver dashboard</strong>. Upon doing so, select whether you want to create a new simulated account with 100 play ETH or to simulate your current account as it exists at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Don’t sleep on the Recipe Creator</strong></h2>



<p>As it currently stands, the Recipe Creator already has the potential to bring in more than a few new DeFi users by making the UX around using DeFi so streamlined and convenient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the DeFi Saver team wants to improve this UX even further with more additions and advancements. For starters, new integrations with DApps like Lido, Liquity, and Yearn are on the slate for the near future as are integrations with promising layer-two (L2) scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync 2.0. The DeFi Saver team is also exploring the automation of recipes, so consider keeping an eye out for that as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are interested in tracking the progress of the Recipe Creator going forward, you can stay up to date on all current happenings by following DeFi Saver on <a href="https://bit.ly/34VQnKF">Twitter</a> or by joining the project’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/XGDJHhZ">Discord</a> community. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There’s a new automated market maker (AMM) on the block, and it has the infrastructure to shake things up in DeFi. The protocol’s tech, which allows the decentralized exchange to feast on the liquidity of other exchanges, is uniquely advantageous for liquidity providers (LPs), so now the race is on to see how many users the project can win over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The DEX in question? <a href="https://integral.link/deposit"><strong>Integral</strong></a>, a new kind of trading protocol that launched in March 2021 and whose team is positioning it to compete with both <em>decentralized </em>crypto exchanges like Uniswap and <em>centralized </em>crypto exchanges like Coinbase.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>An AMM to Eat All AMMs?</strong></h2>



<p>To compete with the exchanges of the world, Integral needs a compelling way to match these exchanges’ liquidity. So what’s one protocol to do against the combined activity of all these other bustling entities?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eIf2Og4K3j8nNVFL5nJ8Qrc3yjSNhKclKz4MAbECv8qCK547sIaNWCiMagEqyYCMJ-TOXTIUy8TOnYTvUoZPim0CkNq-4NfTbj1Q4Fy4vNr_74rQREUgKhNZj_Sgici290erSZAr" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Fortunately for Integral the protocol has an interesting answer, a <strong>new AMM style called an Orderbook AMM, or OB-AMM</strong>. What’s special about this style is it allows Integral to “mirror” its competitors’ external liquidity at will, yet with the major advantage of needing just a <em>fraction </em>of that liquidity in the project’s own pools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is because of how the OB-AMM model achieves what’s known as <strong>concentrated liquidity</strong>, i.e. liquidity that’s distributed along a price range, upon which capital can be condensed in particular places. Integral delivers LPs and traders concentrated liquidity by <strong>decoupling </strong><strong><em>capital</em></strong><strong>, the crypto in the OB-AMM’s pools, from </strong><strong><em>depth</em></strong>, as in an orderbook’s depth or the shapes of pools’ price ranges. The project notably offered this advantage weeks ahead of Uniswap V3, which launched in May 2021 and has since helped popularize concentrated liquidity.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/RcOO6tBh5Dq_0_A6E-4QRLO50f1VzBRTUnwmqmiI8d8VuGR1Ecy3THlraM8riVlqNcPkYtO7zz6iUIR-ZrgUMG4XFfeArIDzi1ryi_Wp2IE3vE_OhTG6BslLo2Yt5-mtIp6VO0lH" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Accordingly, Integral can match the world’s exchanges by taking <em>their </em>orderbooks and mirroring <em>their </em>depth onto Integral’s own pools. This is why Integral currently enjoys +$11B in implied liquidity and same-level price impact while simultaneously having only ~$111.5M in <a href="https://defipulse.com/integral">total value locked (TVL)</a> at the moment. It can provide 3x the depth of Binance’s orderbook, for example, and it needs way less liquidity to do so. The ensuing efficiency helps keep price impact lower and LP APYs higher for users.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Impermanent Profit (IP) is here to stay</strong></h2>



<p>There are two other foundational elements of Integral that make the AMM innovative: the protocol’s <strong>trade delay</strong> system and its <strong>mean-0 impermanent loss</strong> (IL) system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Integral’s <em>trade delay</em> forces traders to wait 5 minutes + Ethereum’s confirmation time, an implementation that protects LPs from the threat of (IL) caused by arbitrageurs and frontrunners. And <em>mean-0 IL</em> entails Integral LPs having IL profiles that oscillate around 0. At times this IL will even become negative, meaning it becomes more profitable to supply an asset to a pool in contrast to just holding it in your wallet, and over time the IL will converge to 0.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The combination of these systems with Integral’s overall efficiency has led to pronounced occasions of what the project’s team is calling <strong><em>impermanent profit</em></strong><strong> </strong>(IP<strong>)</strong>. Again, if IL means you would’ve been better off holding your assets than LPing them, <em>IP</em> means you ended up better off LPing than you would have by just holding the underlying assets.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/tQ3lQMssk8fCt8YGcx0J__JNKosMufKdj9x6GDPoHYzd4DGESJGM7NxD51pGlB2yMDcdIyw0dGVlQc5px-pYVPUt9972rehX2gijQE3JwOswIUfMOguhnwvCUGp8oumyX9VRqwJf" alt=""/></figure>



<p>For instance, LPs of Integral’s ETH-USDT pool saw <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ/status/1396128896542597121">0.5% impermanent profit</a> within the <em>first week</em> of the AMM opening up trading to the public. Of course there are no guarantees for how anything will perform over time, but Integral’s efficiencies mean there’s undoubtedly more such profits where those came from for the project’s LPs going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>ITGR pre-farming continues</strong></h2>



<p>This coming June 7th, Integral’s token genesis event (TGE) will take place for the project’s native ITGR token. </p>



<p>In the meantime, you can already start accruing ITGR rewards by providing liquidity for, or trading through, the AMM’s pools: ETH-WBTC, ETH-DAI, ETH-USDC, ETH-USDT, ETH-LINK, and the project’s newly launched stable pools, <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ/status/1397608962724294658">DAI-USDC, DAI-USDT, and USDC-USDT</a>. With its concentrated liquidity feature, these new pools are designed to deliver the same stablecoin depth and slippage as some of the biggest pools in DeFi, all while leading the industry in stablecoin trading fee levels at 2 bps. </p>



<h2><strong>Keep an eye on Integral</strong></h2>



<p>Integral is all but poised to grow from here, as the protocol’s ability to mirror competitors’s liquidity makes its potential considerable. At the same time the project is still young and has plenty of work on its roadmap, so there’s lots more to track from here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can give <a href="https://integral.link/swap">Integral’s trading pools</a> a try for yourself when you next have the chance, and if you’re wanting to learn more about this game-changing decentralized exchange then you can stay up to speed by following Integral on <a href="https://twitter.com/IntegralHQ">Twitter</a> or by participating in Integral’s communities on <a href="https://discord.com/invite/GJYCF55Tb6">Discord</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Previously, providing liquidity to automated market maker (AMM) projects in DeFi has been a manual and somewhat tedious process. You source the required amount of tokens for your desired pair, approve token contracts, pay gas fees to deposit, and then if you’re looking to farm further yields you might go and stake your new liquidity provider (LP) tokens, which takes yet another transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You go through all these steps only to endure the risk of impermanent loss (IL) while you serve as an LP. Now, though, <em>it is</em> possible to provide liquidity and earn DeFi yields simply and without the risk of IL. That’s because <a href="https://impermax.finance/"><strong>Impermax</strong></a>, a decentralized marketplace for borrowing and lending LP tokens, is offering a game-changing new way to participate in LPing called <em>Indirect Liquidity Providing</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uqVZj40ev81y7CVPscU_0BVsVbfsJJdOBw4VjUjsn0FlIU629FU_0Xnxwji7vd5dEYl2qaZZDIR_l1n-QHD0xv5zWwFbETl4airftBWwWfbQF-iVk3VMoZFQHmnrTNA_r6ThM_Ui" alt=""/></figure>



<h2><strong>A new way to LP in DeFi</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Indirect Liquidity Providing</strong>, a novel way to participate in DeFi liquidity markets, involves earning yield by <em>lending </em>assets to other LP token holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="http://defipulse.com/impermax">Impermax</a> system this works through the protocol’s lending pools, which use LP tokens like ETH-DAI Uniswap V2 LP tokens as collateral. These pools only allow borrowing and lending around a given pool’s token pair, such as ETH and/or DAI if you’re borrowing against ETH-DAI UNI-V2 tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accordingly, DeFi users can now supply a <em>single </em>token to an Impermax lending pool to earn yields indirectly through an AMM, all while facing essentially no threat of impermanent loss. This is in stark contrast to the IL risk users take on when they directly serve as LPs!&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://impermax.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="555" height="329" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2z3yCV7xfTT6sA_rTwCtmQN47qNPcMAicueZTYMiZ9_DZP4SQEghbdR73-3fxZvHPL7D7fsnXJdHC6-v0Kx8kU2EKtvRsAkit5QQp6aO0JtDS4YkjtZBE23z9RhMDhPy2KOzLGHc"></a></p>



<p>In this way, we can understand Impermax as an <strong>Indirect Liquidity market</strong>. Users lend their assets to yield farmers, who then convert these assets into further LP tokens in order to boost their own yields. These yield farmers take on all the risk of impermanent loss while paying out a portion of their yields to pay back their loans from Impermax lenders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Yield farming made simple</strong></h2>



<p>A key advantage of the Indirect Liquidity Providing system is that it offers lenders an easy, simplistic avenue for yield farming. This is because Impermax’s lending markets do away with having to go through multiple steps like acquiring LP tokens and thereafter staking them in order to farm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, <strong>lending through Impermax offers a casual, one-step, staking-like process for yield farming</strong>: you deposit a token into your lending pool of choice, and voila, you’re earning yield and can claim it any time. That’s about as simple as it gets when it comes to farming opportunities in DeFi, so these farms also minimize the need for transactions, which can really add up gas-wise with other traditional yield farms!&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi beginners want entry-level yield farms, and DeFi veterans enjoy simple passive earning opportunities, so Indirect Liquidity Providing has a little something for everyone. This will ensure Impermax will continue to have an important role to play in DeFi, as there’s big demand for simple yield farming solutions while many AMMs are becoming increasingly complex, like Uniswap V3.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Good for DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>To compete with traditional finance, DeFi will need to continue being a liquidity blackhole and continue attracting in more money. More money equals more efficiency, and more efficiency means better options for users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, <strong>Impermax’s Indirect Liquidity Providing innovation represents a benefit for all of DeFi</strong>, insofar as this new lending style makes it easier to provide liquidity to AMMs and can thus help these AMMs grow faster than they would have otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In time, then, we might even see some AMM projects incentivize and promote Impermax’s lending markets since these markets can serve as a direct and increasingly important pipeline of activity to them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Learn more about Impermax</strong></h2>



<p>Impermax is a first-of-its-kind protocol for borrowing and lending LP tokens, so be sure to keep the project on your radar as it now works on adding support for LP tokens from Uniswap V3 and other major DeFi trading protocols like Curve and SushiSwap. You can learn more by following Impermax on <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpermaxFinance">Twitter</a> or by joining in on the project’s community discussions on <a href="https://discord.gg/XN739EgG4X">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ImpermaxFinance">Telegram</a>.</p>
