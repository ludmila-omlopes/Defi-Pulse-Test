										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Introducing <a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">Interest Per Year</a>, or IPY for short, a new metric created by DeFi Pulse used to track the performance of DeFi lending markets.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine IPY like the speedometer for DeFi measuring the speed at which interest is accruing in DeFi lending protocols given the borrow rate and outstanding debt at that moment. IPY is useful for measuring the potential performance changes of lending protocols in the short term.</span></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s truly fascinating about a metric like IPY is the fact that it isn&#8217;t possible without DeFi.</strong> In centralized finance, banks, financial institutions, and regulators control the flow of information. These authorities choose what information gets disclosed to the public. It&#8217;s not like you can walk into your bank and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m here to perform an audit.&#8221; But things are different with DeFi.</p>
<p>With DeFi, all the data is publicly available on-chain for everyone to see. Transparency and real time data are two major&nbsp;advantages DeFi has gained by rebuilding things from scratch. And it&#8217;s up to us as members of the DeFi community to decide how we want to synthesize the data and utilize those advantages.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7742 size-full" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1.jpg" alt="" width="895" height="645" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1.jpg 895w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1-300x216.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1-768x553.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that DeFi lending is still maturing. Historically, the most popular form of collateral has been ETH. And, the most popular asset to borrow has been DAI. Lending rates have been highly correlated to the performance of this trading pair ETH/DAI. While rates may go up and down, outstanding debts have consistently risen over time. Additionally, as DeFi lending matures and new assets like securities, property, real estate, etc enter the picture, metrics like IPY will mature as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7745 size-full" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="815" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326-300x272.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326-768x695.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>Interest Per Year is an example of what&#8217;s possible through DeFi. It&#8217;s a metric that can help market participants better understand the condition of DeFi lending markets.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, DAI&#8217;s IPY is generally greater than USDC&#8217;s but USDC has a more stable IPY. This indicates that there is greater demand for DAI loans overall but USDC is carving out a niche for steady consistent lending returns.</span></p>
<p>Whether you want to analyze historical rates or simply stay ahead of trends in DeFi, the new&nbsp;<a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">DeFi Lending</a>&nbsp;page makes it easier to spot patterns emerging in the market.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our new page supports a variety of assets including DAI, USDC, ETH, REP, ZRX, WBTC, and BAT with lending data from Compound, Maker, dYdX, and Fulcrum.</span></p>
<h3>Witness the growth of DeFi lending markets firsthand</h3>
<p>Decentralized Finance is still in its infancy. It&#8217;s a historic time for the industry and we&#8217;re about to witness events which will shape DeFi forever. In the days ahead, we&#8217;ll see more and more assets be introduced as collateral in DeFi. Not to mention, different lending models will emerge. And on top of it all, more and more people will experience borrowing or lending in DeFi for the first time. We hope <a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">DeFi Lending</a> will give you the tools to capture history in the making.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Margin trading is extremely popular in the cryptocurrency markets. In the past, traders used to rely on centralized exchanges to trade using leverage. But recently, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-dapp/">DApps</a> that provide this kind of trading have become some of the most popular services in <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi/">DeFi</a>.</p>
<h1>What is margin trading?</h1>
<p>Margin trading is a method of trading using borrowed funds allowing you further leverage your existing assets. <strong>Margin trading comes with higher risks than normal trading.</strong>Â Because while it does offer the potential to amplify your gains, it can also amplify losses incurred through trading. In traditional finance, brokers typically provide the funds necessary to open a leveraged position. In DeFi, margin traders borrow cryptocurrencies from decentralized lending protocols powered by smart contracts. Lenders<a href="https://defipulse.com/income"> earn interest rates anywhere from 5-20%</a> for lending their tokens to borrowers like margin traders.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>When you open a margin trade, you select your desired amount of leverage and lock in funds (sometimes referred to as collateral) worth a portion of your total order, also known as your margin. Leverage in this case refers to ratio of borrowed assets to the value of your margin. For example, if you opened a margin trade with 3x leverage worth $3,000, you&#8217;d be required to lock in $1,000 worth of collateral.</p>
<p>Margin trading positions can either by long or short. Opening a long position means you believe that the price will go up. Whereas, opening a short position, also known as shorting, means you believe the price of the asset your trading will go down.</p>
<p>To new traders with little collateral, margin trading can be very appealing because it gives you access to more capital. However, you should be aware that trading with leverage multiplies your profits <em>and your losses</em>, meaning that <strong>you should never risk more than you&#8217;re willing to lose</strong>. If the value of your margin falls or the price does not go the way you predicted and your trade becomes over-leveraged, your margin trade can be liquidated and your collateral can be sold to repay the assets you borrowed plus interest.</p>
<h1>Top Margin Trading Platforms in DeFi</h1>
<p>DeFi margin trading platforms are built using smart contracts which enforce trading rules and facilitate the loans between lenders and borrowers, or rather margin traders in this case. When you margin trading cryptocurrency on any of these platforms, you will pay interest on any assets that you borrow. Potential leverage and borrowing interest rates vary from platform to platform. And, the interest you pay is subject to fluctuation depending on the platform&#8217;s available supply and demand for loans.</p>
