<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Injective-Header-1-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9029" width="1024" height="512"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To kick off our Founder Fireside Chat series, we speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/ericinjective">Eric Chen</a>, Co-founder of <a href="https://injectiveprotocol.com/">Injective Protocol</a>, who is working to bring unparalleled access to new decentralized derivatives markets with restrictions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Injective Protocol is the first fully decentralized exchange protocol that unlocks the full potential of decentralized derivatives and borderless DeFi. Injective Protocol enables fully decentralized trading without any restrictions, allowing individuals to trade on any derivative market of their choosing. A few unique features set us apart from the rest. We are devoid of any and all gas fees, which means no one has to pay the ridiculously high gas fees that currently plague the Ethereum ecosystem. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition, we enable a higher level of interoperability given our integration with the Cosmos network. We are also an orderbook model exchange with instant finality, so traders are able to trade more freely without having to worry about slippage and other issues on DEXs today. Our scaling infrastructure also allows us to scale Ethereum-based transactions with composability with the greater DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would have to go with decentralization. <strong>If we sacrifice decentralization, we&#8217;re no better than the legacy CeFi infrastructure.</strong> As a result, I think that this is the most important aspect that sets apart blockchain-based systems from other platforms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I believe decentralized derivatives hold tremendous promise. In traditional finance, <strong>this sector encompasses literally quadrillions of dollars</strong>. If DeFi can capture even 1% of this market, it would tremendously help accelerate the adoption of crypto-based networks as a whole.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Due to the technical nature of our team and origin, we started off Injective with an overly complicated structure that proved to be unsustainable in the long run due to its engineering challenges. <strong>What we&#8217;ve learned is that we should take Occam&#8217;s razor approach when it comes to product focus and development.</strong> This way we can provide a clear avenue and value proposition for new traders to access our ecosystem. This is why we built a user-friendly frontend that helps to abstract away the decentralized infrastructure, leading to an exchange that can be adopted globally.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>NGMI</strong><br><em>Editor&#8217;s note: For those of you unaware, 1) NGMI 2) that stands for &#8220;Not Gonna Make It&#8221;</em></p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Special thanks to Eric for taking the time to chat with us. You can find Eric on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/ericinjective">@ericinjective</a> and on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/injective-protocol/">LinkedIn</a>.

					<description><![CDATA[Recent events have made it all too clear to the average user why decentralization has a key role to play...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recent events have made it all too clear to the average user why decentralization has a key role to play in having a fair and efficient market. Futureswap aims to disrupt the multi-billion dollar perpetual futures trading market currently dominated by centralized services. Futureswap takes a different approach with a hybrid between Uniswap and a perpetual futures exchange platform governed by the community. You may remember Futureswap from their <a href="https://medium.com/futureswap/futureswap-lessons-learned-from-a-3-day-alpha-be4e37bc8c52">successful Alpha in April 2020 which ultimately ended early</a> after DeFi users flocked to the platform in overwhelming numbers. In less than 3 days, Futureswap’s Alpha 24hr trading volume grew to $17M and liquidity passed $1M. Erring on the side of caution, the Futureswap team decided to end the Alpha earlier than initially planned.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Now they’re back with something even better, the Futureswap V2 Beta is </strong><a href="https://futureswap.com/"><strong>already launched on mainnet</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The Futureswap V2 Beta includes upgrades like live pricing and higher capital efficiency which aim to provide a perpetual futures trading experience that outperforms <em>centralized</em> exchanges.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-1-1024x494.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8860"/></figure>



<h2>What makes Futureswap V2 Beta special?</h2>



<p>Futureswap is a decentralized exchange platform with an automatic market maker (AMM) design that enables traders to enter leveraged perpetual futures with low slippage. Its automatic market maker (AMM) design provides higher capital efficiency offering up to 10x leverage. According to Futureswap: after $50m in liquidity, Futureswap should have better price execution for a $1m trade than any other decentralized exchange and after $300m it has the lowest slippage compared to centralized exchanges based on the current slippage parameters. </p>



<p>Additionally, Futureswap pools can be very efficient with their use of capital resulting in more stability and potentially high returns for liquidity providers compared to traditional AMM exchanges. Futureswap utilizes what’s called a Dynamic Funding Rate or DFR for short. The DFR is a borrowing fee based on the total trade size designed to maintain the volume balance between open longs and shorts. During times of disproportionate demand, liquidity providers’ pooled assets are used to take up the opposite side of any unmatched trades. So if there were tons of unmatched ETH longs, LPs cover the ETH essentially opening a short.</p>



<p>Long and short volumes are pooled and then the more popular pool is charged the dynamic funding rate and it’s paid to the pool in low demand.<strong> </strong>This mechanism limits extreme volatility and properly rewards liquidity providers for their exposure to risk. The DFR keeps increasing as the disparity grows to disincentivize trades on the popular side. In other words, the longs pay the shorts or vice versa until the sides become balanced. This also means that liquidity providers have the potential to earn more thanks to the DFR.</p>



<h3>Oracle Relayer Network (ORN)</h3>



<p>One of the biggest improvements Futureswap V2 brings is the new Oracle Relayer Network (ORN) which enables instant pricing and real-time trading. ORN has been described as a mesh between a price oracle and a meta-transaction processor node. Futureswap users are able to trade in real-time by signing a message including their order and submitting them to ORN. Then, ORN verifies the signed message and finalizes the trade on-chain at the current price. Transactions will fail if outside accurate price bounds set by ORN to protect users. The Futureswap team is taking further steps to improve the Oracle Relayer Network’s security with audits by <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a> and plans to add more nodes to the network.</p>



<h2><br><strong>How Futureswap works</strong></h2>



<h3>Traders</h3>



<p>As we’ve covered, <a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/">traders on Futureswap can open long or short perpetual future positions with up to 10x leverage</a> in real-time with instant pricing. Perpetual futures on Futureswap have no time limits and can remain open as long as the trader has enough collateral. Traders will either pay or earn the dynamic funding rate when opening longs or shorts depending on whether they are on the popular side of the trade or not. Traders also earn FST token rewards each epoch based on their percentage of close trade volume that distribution period.<br></p>



<h3>Liquidity providers</h3>



<p>Liquidity Providers<a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/pool"> add liquidity to Futureswap pools</a> in equal parts to earn trading fees and FST token rewards. For example, if you wanted to add liquidity to Futureswap’s ETH/USDC pool, you would need $100 worth of ETH and 100 USDC. Once deposited, LP tokens are minted representing your share of the pool. These LP tokens can be redeemed at any time if their liquidity is not in a trade. Liquidity providers earn trading fees for allowing traders to use their liquidity. Liquidity providers also earn FST token rewards as an incentive to further grow Futureswap’s available liquidity.</p>



<h3>Liquidators</h3>



<p>Liquidators monitor the platform for positions that are close to violating margin requirements and send liquidation transactions to close at-risk positions for a liquidator fee. It’s vital to the health and stability of the platform for positions to be reliably closed once they reach their liquidation price. It’s worth mentioning that submitting these transactions does not require the liquidator to provide any value or to take over the trade. They simply close the trade on behalf of the protocol and are rewarded for doing so. Currently, the percentage that liquidators receive is 30% of the remaining collateral up to a maximum (currently set to 500 USDC).</p>



<h2>Futureswap is governed by the community</h2>



<p>FST is Futureswap’s non-transferable governance token which is<a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/rewards"> rewarded to traders, liquidity providers, and referrers each day.</a>&nbsp; FST allows the Futureswap community to propose and vote on changes to the protocol, enabling it to evolve and improve over time. We’ve already mentioned FST tokens a few times covering Futureswap’s various incentives designed to incentivize user participation. <a href="https://medium.com/futureswap/futureswap-governance-token-distribution-d2712c855da5">FST is used to reward the Futureswap</a> users contributing to the growth and adoption of the platform. And since Futureswap is governed by the community, this gives the most active users influence over the future of the platform. In other words, users who participate sooner rather than later after the community grows even larger are more likely to have a larger impact with their contributions and receive more FST rewards.</p>



<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>



<p>Potentially disrupting such a big market like perpetual futures presents an opportunity for Futureswap. Futureswap is designed with the expectations of serious trades in mind. Futureswap’s design with its high capital efficiency and low slippage lends itself well to larger trades for whales and industry traders. Its instant pricing and real-time trading ORN system provides a better trading experience with built-in protections against front running attacks. Futureswap may also continue to provide even lower slippage as liquidity grows over time. FST rewards increase the likelihood of this occurring by incentivizing adoption.</p>



<p>Try <a href="https://www.futureswap.com/">Futureswap</a> today and start earning FST rewards. Also, be sure to check out the Futureswap community on <a href="https://twitter.com/futureswapx">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/ZCcxtu9VxH">Discord</a>.</p>



<p><em>Disclosure: This post is part of our paid promotional DeFi Pulse Drop series; We’ve partnered with Futureswap to help educate and inform the community about the launch of Futureswap V2 Beta. </em><em>DeFi Pulse received FST tokens as part of its payment. </em><em>As always, we’re committed to providing the entire community with quality, objective information, and any opinions we express are our own.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many would argue that generating yield with stablecoins is currently one of DeFi’s biggest use cases. So it’s no wonder we’ve seen a flurry of different stablecoins, yield aggregators and vaults entering the market, each with their own tokenized representation of yield-bearing stablecoins. You can almost picture these yield-bearing tokens like snowflakes; each similar at a glance but entirely unique when examined closely. When snowflakes are combined they become an indistinguishable mass that can be shaped to create something more like a snowman or igloo. Whether you prefer to look at protocols and tokens like snowflakes or money legos, there are undeniable benefits to combining and layering different DeFi protocols to create something new. This is precisely the logic behind <a href="https://snowswap.org/">SnowSwap</a> which aims to be the defacto way to swap yield-bearing assets like stablecoins, tokenized BTC, ETH2 staking tokens and other similar assets.</p>



<h2>What is SnowSwap?</h2>



<p>Imagine you have USDC deposited into yEarn’s yUSDC vault but you notice you could be earning a higher yield using yDAI. You could pay the gas required for all the transactions to withdraw your USDC, convert it to DAI, and then re-deposit your DAI into Yearn or you could save yourself the hassle and use SnowSwap. <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/snowswap-bringing-liquidity-to-stablecoin-yield-farming-12e222af0462">SnowSwap</a>, based on Curve’s AMM model, allows users to easily enter and exit yVaults and other yield bearing tokens for only the cost of a swap fee. Increasing liquidity for similar yield-bearing tokens makes it easier for users to speculate on their yield or performance. SnowSwap’s first pools, <a href="https://snowswap.org/iearn/">yVault USD</a> (yDAI, yUSDC, yUSDT, yTUSD) and <a href="https://snowswap.org/busd/">yVault Curve</a> (yUSD, ybCRV), were focused on yield-bearing stablecoin tokens. It didn’t stop at stablecoins though; the <a href="https://snowswap.org/pusd/">btcSNOW pool</a> (YcrvRenWSBTC, FcrvRenWBTC) features yield-bearing tokenized versions of BTC from yEarn and Harvest Finance.</p>



<p>The next step in SnowSwap’s journey went even further by introducing a new pool called <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/%EF%B8%8Fbuilding-on-2-0-with-eth2snow-and-sharedstake-partnership-%EF%B8%8F-5ca251f8e1a0">eth2SNOW</a> designed to incentivize Eth2 adoption. SnowSwap’s <a href="https://snowswap.org/ethsnow/">eth2SNOW pool</a> aims to create new markets and utility via the ability to enter, exit, and swap between popular eth2 staking services with low slippage. This pool includes vETH2, aETH by ANKR, CRETH2 by CREAM, WETH. eth2SNOW provides a few key advantages for users:</p>



<ul><li>Enables users to conveniently enter and exit Eth2 staking services using WETH</li><li>Allows users to optimize for the highest APY % with low slippage swaps</li><li>Alleviates minimum ETH entry required for aETH</li><li>Liquidity providers gain exposure to Eth2 staking and earn a portion of swap fees</li></ul>



<p>In general, providing liquidity to SnowSwap’s pools provides a simpler and more cost effective way to gain exposure to a basket of yield-bearing assets with the added benefit of receiving a portion of swap fees. When a user provides liquidity to a SnowSwap pool, they receive either ySNOW, ycrvSNOW, btcSNOW, eth2SNOW tokens depending on the pool. Liquidity providers can stake these tokens to earn additional yield in the form of SNOW, SnowSwap’s governance token. 80% of the total SNOW tokens will be distributed to SnowSwap liquidity providers via liquidity mining rewards designed to bootstrap liquidity as well as the SnowSwap community.</p>



<h2>Progressing towards decentralization with The Snow DAO</h2>



<p>The SnowSwap team envisions The Snow DAO to play an important role in the future of SnowSwap. In this vision, <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/f-k-making-it-rain-were-making-it-snow-e60b64ad1292">SNOW</a> would grant users the ability to vote on governance proposals to modify or add to the SnowSwap protocol. For example, a future proposal could be voted in that distributes swap fees to SNOW holders. Nonetheless, the SnowSwap team<a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/snow-whats-next-29639c181732"> also believes </a>that poorly executed token governance can slow down the growth of a protocol. For this reason,&nbsp; they want to explore the possibilities with the community and collaborate to forge a path towards decentralization together. For example, one idea floated by the SnowSwap team was having community-based executives. In the meantime, the SnowSwap team covers the cost of development via the 10% of SNOW given to the Dev Fund on a 3-year vesting schedule. Additionally, 8% of SNOW was issued to the SnowSwap Foundation, a treasury used to fund initiatives and incentivize the growth of the ecosystem such as security audits, partner programs, and grants.</p>



<h3>Growing the SNOW community with positive-sum feedback loops</h3>



<p>At its core, SnowSwap is exploring the possibilities of forging symbiotic relationships leveraging the positive-sum nature of DeFi. Its pools provide liquidity between tokens staked in various DeFi protocols, creating a market to swap these tokens which had previously been so fragmented and illiquid. This encourages users to engage with these tokens and in turn creates additional utility for their respective communities. Members of these communities who use SnowSwap, earning them SNOW rewards, then also become members of the SnowSwap community. You can probably see where this leads… the more projects SnowSwap provides utility to, the more the communities grow, and so on to form a positive sum feedback loop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In line with this positive-sum mentality, The SnowSwap Foundation will invest in initiatives and teams which add value to the SnowSwap ecosystem. This strategy referred to as ‘Offensive Forkability’ supports community experimentation and encourages innovation. For example, grants could be funded to explore protocol design experiments. The goal of this strategy is to create network value by collaborating with SnowSwap to disincentivize vampire attacks. In other words, the strategy embodies the phrase: “If you can’t beat them, join them.”</p>



<h2>So what’s in store for SnowSwap?</h2>



<p>SnowSwap is keeping busy between new partnerships and crossing community milestones. The self-proclaimed army of “White Walkers&#8221; continues to grow with recently launched dedicated communities for its SnowSwap users in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India. <a href="https://twitter.com/Quantstamp/status/1343744581007933440?s=20">Quantstamp reviewed SnowSwap’s contracts</a> clearing the path to more major partnerships. Meanwhile, the eth2SNOW pool made in partnership with ANKR now has over 1000 ETH tokens. And now, it’s been<a href="https://twitter.com/snow_swap/status/1353059315968479232"> announced</a> that 1inch is integrating SnowSwap’s liquidity pools. SnowSwap pools will likely see increased trading volume from DEX aggregators and earn more trading fees for liquidity providers as a result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the sound of it, there’s even more brewing behind the scenes. SnowSwap told us that they have 5 major partners that they plan to reveal in the near future. So don’t be surprised to see new potential pools, tokenized assets and/or other developments coming soon. To be the first to hear about these new partnerships, we recommend you follow SnowSwap on the platform of your choice: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/CSSJTs4">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/Snow_Swap">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/snow_swap">Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already, we recommend you go <a href="https://snowswap.org/">check out SnowSwap</a> and see how its low slippage AMM design can offer you more convenience and utility.<br><br><br><em>Disclosure: This post is part of our paid promotional DeFi Pulse Drop series; We’ve partnered with SnowSwap to help educate and inform the community about their protocol.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In traditional finance, leaner banking models without physical locations allowed online banks to cut costs and pass the benefits onto the customer. Banking services built on decentralized networks like Ethereum can offer even more advantages by further reducing operational costs such as securing assets which would traditionally be held in custody. Non-custodial protocols like DeFiner allow users to access savings and loans anytime, anywhere with an internet connection putting you in control of your money.</p>



<p><a href="https://definer.org/">DeFiner</a> is a non-custodial protocol which aims to be a better banking experience than traditional banks by making full use of the disruptive innovations happening in DeFi. Since its founding in 2018, DeFiner has gone on to <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/79450/definerorg-wins-detroit-fintech-challenge/">win the Detroit Fintech Challenge in August 2019</a> and participated in the <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/announcing-the-inaugural-class-of-techstars-hub71-accelerator">Techstars Accelerator</a> and Microsoft Startup Program. Partnerships with both names from traditional tech firms like Microsoft and Consensus Labs as well as names from DeFi like Wyre and Kyber have helped DeFiner move closer towards its goal. DeFiner envisions a complete range of DeFi banking services starting with its first two products: peer-to-peer lending and DeFi savings.</p>

<h2>DeFiner’s Taurus savings takes advantage of existing money legos</h2>



<p>DeFiner <a href="https://blog.definer.org/taurus-launch">launched Taurus Savings Accounts</a> in late November 2020. Taurus Savings Accounts work similar to DeFi money markets you’re likely familiar with. You can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow against your collateral. While loans on the DeFiner protocol are overcollateralized, DeFiner takes advantage of existing DeFi protocols to offer its users borrowing and lending interest rates typically better than the industry average. You see DeFiner takes a portion of the collateral held in its reserves and lends it out on popular money markets like Compound or Maker to earn interest. In other words, DeFiner increases capital utilization to up to more than 85% to reduce the spread between borrowing and lending rates. </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that while this does indeed lower the spread, it comes at the cost of added composability and economic risks. Imagine a scenario where the value of a collateral asset drops quickly or a bug is found and exploited and Compound is unable to cover existing debts. This in turn may mean DeFiner could also be left with insufficient collateral unable to cover existing debts.</p>



<p>When things don’t go as planned, DeFiner allows borrowers to pay back their loans with their collateral. Triggering a self-liquidation sells your desired collateral at a 2% discount in order to cover your debt and avoid a forced liquidation, which bears a 5% collateral discount. Both discounted rates are designed to attract liquidators to participate in collateral auctions and ensure debts can reliably be covered in a timely manner.</p>



<p>DeFiner protocol uses its native token FIN to reward its most active users as well as incentivize users to help meet demand in highly sought after lending markets like USDC and DAI. DeFiner protocol releases new FIN tokens via its Proof of Premium (POP) distribution mechanism. Proof of Premium verifies the premium the prover (lenders and borrowers) generated in a specified time interval. To sum up POP, the more capital committed by a user for longer time periods and higher interest rates results in more FIN tokens being rewarded through the POP mining mechanism. FIN token holders can vote on the follow four categories: lending platform changes (i.e. loan to collateral value ratios, transaction fees, etc.), determining how platform fees are distributed, determining the distribution of FIN token rewards, and electing the board of directors for the DeFiner Organization, a non-profit entity which maintains and promotes the growth of the DeFiner lending platform and community. Currently, 100% of transaction fees and 10% of all interest generated by loans on the DeFiner protocol are distributed to FIN token holders. Learn more about FIN token and Proof of Premium <a href="https://github.com/DeFinerOrg/whitepaper/wiki/DeFiner-Whitepaper#definer-token-fin-economy">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>Decentralized finance has been a series of innovations each one building on the next. That’s why it’s nice to see DeFiner exploring ways to utilize secondary money markets to improve its own money market for the benefit of its users. DeFiner plans to release a mobile app in the future. With the ever increasing popularity of mobile banking, this feels like a natural progression of DeFiner’s mission to reduce friction for users. <a href="https://twitter.com/definerorg">Follow DeFiner on Twitter</a> to keep up with the latest updates.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There’s no doubt that 2020 was a wild ride for everyone, especially for anyone involved in DeFi. When you look back at the year, it’s honestly hard to wrap your head around how much things have changed in our community. There are so many projects that launched this year that have become core to the foundation of decentralized finance. Many new projects rose to fill the needs of the ecosystem and many more challenged our preconceived notions of what was thought possible or where DeFi was headed at the start of the year. To round out the year, we thought it would be best to take a moment to celebrate the Top Builders in DeFi of 2020 as nominated by you in our first ever community survey. </p>



<h2>Top Builders in DeFi of 2020</h2>



<p>Without further ado, here are the results:<br><br>Andre Cronje won DeFi&#8217;s MVP builder, engineer, and top project lead of 2020. Fellow YFI proponent Banteg came in second for the top engineer in DeFi of 2020.<br><br>Argent won the top UX/UI of 2020 with honorable mentions going to both DeFi Saver and Synthetix.<br><br>Ryan Sean Adams won DeFi&#8217;s top communications lead of 2020.<br><br>Anthony Sassano won DeFi&#8217;s top community manager of 2020.<br><br>As many guessed, Samczun won DeFi&#8217;s top white hat hacker and top auditor of 2020.</p>



<p>Kudos to all of you and your hard work! DeFi wouldn’t be what it is today without your contributions!<br><br>Now on a more personal level, we’d like to highlight the ways we here at DeFi Pulse have grown in 2020.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Adapters</h2>



<p>It feels like forever ago that we released the <a href="https://github.com/ConcourseOpen/DeFi-Pulse-Adapters">open source adapter framework</a> that now powers our metrics on the DeFi Pulse leaderboard in February 2020. In the past, we had to learn each project and code their adapters ourselves. This new framework allowed projects to collaborate with our team making the listing process faster and ensuring TVL metrics were measured accurately. This year alone we more than doubled the number of projects on DeFi Pulse, listing close to 40 new projects in 2020 (not including any updates to existing projects): <a href="https://defipulse.com/aave">Aave</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/alpha-homora">Alpha Homora</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/auctus">Auctus</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/balancer">Balancer</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/b.protocol">B.Protocol</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/c.r.e.a.m.-finance">C.R.E.A.M.

<h2>Setting new records for Total Value Locked (TVL)</h2>



<p>The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi grew exponentially during 2020. With more than $14B TVL currently, this was a year of massive growth across all DeFi categories. We saw the birth of dozens of new projects, the emergence of new ways of distributing ownership to the community, the consolidation of open orgs as a novel coordination system, and massive technological experimentation that brought tremendous innovation to DeFi. One can&#8217;t help but wonder what DeFi&#8217;s growth will be in 2021 and what new innovations we will witness. But one thing is for sure, though: these are still very early days, and we&#8217;re only beginning to see what the future of finance will look like.</p>



<h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/dMVfoTQwv0JVf-_X611Isx86nm_aTyYieJGC2i_bMFA6hCGOhPOcsT4lLG3E_AiRoc6t83_61_uu6jGEBjKJQqNdE_Dsb7Yt-Dq7y6MPCJgmORoCmEXCMoPRWdi-Gl5zqncapmNV" width="458" height="231"></h2>



<p>It seems hard to believe that we were celebrating that the <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/1-billion-tvl-in-defi/">(TVL) had hitted the $1B</a> mark for the first time less than one year ago.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Data</h2>



<p>In April 2020, we<a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/see-the-bigger-picture-with-defi-pulse-data/"> released</a> <a href="https://data.defipulse.com/">DeFi Pulse Data</a> combining DeFi Pulse’s popular metrics with data from Concourse Open’s other popular services’ APIs like <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/">ETHGasStation</a>. Whether you’re writing a blog post analyzing DeFi or building an application that needs accurate gas prices from ETH Gas Station, any task benefits from the right information. We’ve been thrilled to see what the community has done with our data at their disposal.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Drops</h2>



<p>We launched DeFi Pulse Drops, a promotional series where we partnered with projects to inform the community about their latest features, releases, and builds. All in all, we provided in-depth analysis of the following projects throughout 2020: <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/futureswap/">Futureswap</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/balancer-start-liquidity-mining-and-earn-bal-tokens-today/">Balancer</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/mcdex/">MCDEX</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/introducing-mstable/">mStable</a>, Rari Capital <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/rari-capital/">v1</a> and <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/rari-capital-v2/">v2</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/aco/">Auctus</a>’s ACO, Akropolis’s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/delphi/">Delphi, Perpetual Protocol</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/lien/">Lien</a>, Hakka’s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/3f-mutual/">3F Mutual</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dextf/">DEXTF</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/deversifi-nectar-beehive-v1/">DeversiFi</a>, and <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/harvest-finance-drop/">Harvest Finance</a>.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Farmer</h2>



<p>This year’s most important trend within the DeFi space was, without a doubt, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/the-yield-farming-frenzy-and-its-impact-on-defi/">yield farming</a>. Ignited by the launch of the COMP governance token in June, farming developed into one of the key strategies most projects relied on to attract capital to their platforms. By distributing ownership of their protocols to the DeFi community via liquidity incentives in the form of governance tokens, projects grew the liquidity of their platforms exponentially, making the TVL break all-time highs consistently during most weeks of Q3 and Q4.<br><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZmckhJ5sGa2qwaeDds0vUdEHjjJvKk1Rx1Fh4mK4frzcfO42WtTjPBbHMCTTkCjenkiOFIe2ImQKiCVd1I_Jwo3xrhjlP3W7cw6SCJzEl8EA_-6_Pz0i6Wo1PZjpsmZr--tl_-oS" width="624" height="112"></p>



<p>In early August, we launched the <a href="https://yieldfarmer.substack.com/">DeFi Pulse Farmer newsletter</a> to extensively cover this massive trend and get to the heart of the most critical innovations in the space. Currently at edition #21, DeFi Pulse Farmer also offers premium subscribers access to the Alpha Tractor and Protocol Express series. You can <a href="https://yieldfarmer.substack.com/subscribe?utm_source=menu&amp;simple=true&amp;next=https%3A%2F%2Fyieldfarmer.substack.com%2F">sign up to DeFi Pulse Farmer here</a>.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Index</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi">DeFi Pulse Index</a> (DPI), a capitalization weighted index built on Set Protocol’s V2 infrastructure consisting of the most popular DeFi tokens available on Ethereum was<a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-pulse-index/"> launched in September 2020</a>. DeFi Pulse Index was the first of its kind, an index of decentralized finance that wasn’t synthetic or a derivative but rather you own the underlying DeFi tokens and can redeem them using your DPI. Much like our Total Value Locked (TVL) metrics, we aimed to make DeFi Pulse Index a standard the community could stand behind. At the time of writing, DPI is the leading DeFi index token with 5769 holders and a market capitalization of over $25M.</p>

<h2>DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade</h2>



<p>In October 2020, the <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/introducing-the-defi-pulse-economic-safety-grade/">DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade was released in partnership with Gauntlet</a> and added to <a href="https://defipulse.com/compound">Compound</a> and <a href="https://defipulse.com/aave">Aave</a>’s project pages on DeFi Pulse. As the name implies, each Economic Safety Grade is a 1 to 100 grade that allows users to more easily quantify and compare the economic risks of using on-chain protocols. Grades are created by running simulations utilizing data from centralized and decentralized exchanges combined with on-chain user data to estimate market risks. For a more in-depth explanation of the simulation model, we recommend you read this <a href="https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/understanding-risk-in-defi-f64574593979">blog post from Gauntlet</a>.</p>



<h2>Bitcoin at Work</h2>



<p>Marking the last major release for DeFi Pulse in 2020, our team <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/introducing-bitcoin-at-work/">unveiled a new page </a>highlighting the use of Bitcoin in the DeFi ecosystem called <a href="https://defipulse.com/btc">Bitcoin at Work</a>. We worked with 10 different teams from all across the industry to support a wide variety of BTC tokens at launch including: WBTC, RENBTC, HBTC, sBTC, tBTC, imBTC, oBTC, acBTC, pBTC, and BTC++. Thanks again to the team’s who coordinated with us on this launch. Aside from recognizing the hard work and growth of this sector, we hope the metrics and information included in this new page will help DeFi users discover new possibilities and make more informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/espfahPdgGdQCx3GUwVEmNd8Wv4-D10oKwYZAAF_pE0S4g1qx3acdEDloF_CNTh3_Nj3YCY9DwLT-2ZcPqAwaa9vnpw3Kzr1t75tegsI3h34BBXF8plgJjnVAB-cBAYxM0cEDbU6" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/btc"></a></p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Thank you to each and every one of you reading this. With all the flashy numbers and tech, it can be easy to forget that DeFi begins and ends with the people that make up this community. There would be no value, liquidity, or any other metrics to measure without the time and attention each one of us dedicates to building a brighter future together. Our team’s resolution for 2021 is to keep working with project communities to highlight the awesome work being done in this space with the platform we’ve been given by you. Thanks for reading and have a happy new year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the course of 2020, more than 140,000 BTC entered the DeFi ecosystem. With so many different alternatives for Bitcoin tokens, it only makes sense to break it out into its own page to provide more detailed metrics. We&#8217;re excited to introduce a new page highlighting the use of Bitcoin in the DeFi ecosystem. <a href="http://defipulse.com/btc">Bitcoin at Work</a> measures the total amount of BTC being utilized within decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="http://defipulse.com/btc"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-1024x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8793" width="512" height="512" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-150x150.png 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-768x768.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>We worked with 10 different teams from all across our industry to bring you a wide variety of BTC token metrics. <strong>The following BTC tokens will be included at launch:&nbsp;WBTC, RENBTC, HBTC, sBTC, tBTC, imBTC, oBTC, acBTC, pBTC, and BTC++.</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-1024x512.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8785" width="768" height="384" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-1024x512.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-300x150.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-768x384.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<p>As you might have noticed, WBTC has been moved to this new page and its TVL is no longer included in the TVL metrics found on our homepage. WBTC was originally added to the leaderboard at a time when it was practically the only tokenized BTC utilized in DeFi, but given the current landscape we now think it is a better fit for the Bitcoin at Work leaderboard.</p>



<p>We know that not every BTC token is quite the same. Each one has its own method of minting and redeeming and varying degrees of centralization ranging from custodial to fully decentralized.<strong> </strong><br><strong>We broke down each BTC token into four types to better distinguish their different qualities:<br></strong><br><strong>Decentralized</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held within a fully decentralized protocol<br><br><strong>Custodial</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held in custody by a third party<br><br><strong>Synthetic</strong> &#8211; a token which follows the price of Bitcoin but is not directly backed by BTC<br><br><strong>Hybrid</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held within an open protocol transitioning towards decentralization</p>



<p>Aside from recognizing the hard work and growth of this sector, we hope the metrics and information included in this new page will help DeFi users discover new possibilities and make more informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Special thanks to all the teams for working with us! Be sure to check out the new page and explore the <a href="http://defipulse.com/btc">Bitcoin at Work</a> metrics for yourself. And if you’re interested in joining the DeFi Pulse Leaderboard, please check out this <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-to-join-the-defi-pulse-leaderboard/">step-by-step guide.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let’s face it&#8230; In the heat of the moment when it matters most you want to be using the fastest, cheapest way to execute that critical trade. And when you trade on most DEXes, network congestion and the subsequent high gas fees impact your performance. Pay too low of a gas price and you’ll be stuck waiting around, sometimes only to have your transaction revert. So, your other option is to crank up the gas price and pay gas fees which add up over time, eating into your profits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These limitations can lead to a less-than-desirable experience for traders, especially those coming from centralized exchanges. Over the past few years, countless hours of research have gone into creating layer 2 technologies that allow DeFi applications like DEXes to scale far beyond what’s possible on layer 1. DeversiFi has made it their mission to provide a professional trading platform for traders as the first exchange on Ethereum to adopt StarkWare’s Validium Rollups Layer 2 scaling technology.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>DeversiFi in a nutshell</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.deversifi.com/"><strong>DeversiFi</strong></a><strong> is a self-custodial layer 2 DEX capable of processing up to 9000 transactions per second by utilizing zero-knowledge transaction batching technology. </strong>The next chapter for DeversiFi and the Nectar ecosystem begins soon with the launch of Nectar Beehive V1, a liquidity mining initiative designed to further bootstrap the Nectar community and produce sustainable, long-term liquidity for the NEC ecosystem.</p>



<h1>The Evolution of DeversiFi</h1>



<p>When you hear the term ‘liquidity mining’ you probably think of fly-by-night food token farms, however NEC, the token of the DeversiFi ecosystem, is in a category of its own. DeversiFi and the Nectar ecosystem have been pioneers of <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/introducing-the-nectar-token-58ba40e5419a/">liquidity mining in the DeFi space since 2017</a> and are backed by notable partners such as ParaFi Capital, D1 Ventures, BR Capital, StarkWare, Bitfinex, ConsenSys, and Infura.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Originally <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/279">incubated by Bitfinex</a> (now fully independent), DeversiFi began as Ethfinex Trustless, a decentralized exchange with a hybrid infrastructure with deep-liquidity from aggregated order books which access liquidity from exchanges like Bitfinex. <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/introducing-the-nectar-token-58ba40e5419a/">Nectar (NEC) was introduced in 2017</a> as one of the first liquidity mining tokens as a way to reward Ethfinex users with a stake in the future development, governance and success of the platform. Ethfinex eventually closed its doors in August 2019 leaving behind 17000 ETH which was entrusted to NEC holders via the Nectar DAO, or NecDAO for short.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Piecing together DeversiFi, NEC, and NecDAO</h1>



<p>Nectar’s original purpose was to incentivize liquidity on Ethfinex offering 50% of the centralized exchange’s trading fees. But after Ethfinex closed its doors, the remaining 17,000 ETH was passed onto the Nectar DAO and <a href="https://nectar.community/whitepaper">the role of NEC tokens has since expanded</a> to become the governance and utility token of the Nectar and DeversiFi ecosystem. The primary goal of Nectar is to grow the world’s largest community of decentralized exchange users. NEC tokens can be staked to earn reputation and become a voting member of NecDAO. Learn more about <a href="https://nectar.community/dao">Nectar DAO</a>.</p>



<p>NEC is deflationary with the supply being reduced over time through a buy-and-burn model. Each week, up to 50% of the revenue from DeversiFi trading fees (based on daily trading volumes) are used to purchase NEC tokens through an open and transparent auction mechanism. These NEC tokens are then burned reducing the total supply.</p>



<p>DeversiFi offers unique trading fee discounts to NEC token holders. On top of the trading fee discounts DeversiFi users receive based on their 30d trading volume, Nectar holders will soon be entitled to additional discounts of up to 20% depending on the average amount of Nectar tokens that they hold (and have locked inside DeversiFi) for the past 30 days. For example, if a trader expects to do 10 million USD of trading volume every 30 days, buying and holding 100,000 NEC could save them ~$4000 in fees per 30 days.</p>



<p>You can see how DeversiFi and NecDAO have a symbiotic relationship. The more users trade on DeversiFi, the more NEC tokens are burned, the more valuable NEC becomes, the greater the value of the potential discounts NEC holders can receive. NecDAO and NEC holders benefit from generating proposals which improve DeversiFi and attract more trading volume. DeversiFi, in turn, has a dedicated community of NEC stakeholders that boost trading volumes and generally promote their platform.</p>



<h1>Introducing Beehive, Nectar’s new liquidity mining initiative<img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AEwu1MgeUK5S0tl0uXQodikfIOanlcWYVuse6Q0MkTmU9aiFDKMarX9s6vMtzaK1eXFSeyBU7p17Q0aAKtFmA6dYlSWSIR3tU3XV-KAkfWxi51od7v-bKYvk7AIGsIhGKiMsljo1" width="624" height="324"></h1>



<p>Nectar Beehive V1 is a new community bootstrapping and liquidity mining initiative for the DeversiFi ecosystem that returns NEC to its roots of rewarding market makers.</p>



<p>Nectar Beehive will allow liquidity providers to stake their tokens and earn NEC and BAL token rewards, offering multipliers up to 2x for those who also trade on DeversiFi. Of course, APY varies and is subject to many factors such as the price of NEC tokens and total participation in Nectar Beehive. Inspired by other popular liquidity mining initiatives, NEC rewards will be&nbsp; vested for 1 year, limiting sell pressure on the market and producing a sustainable source of liquidity for NEC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nectar Beehive V1 officially launches on Tuesday December 1st, 2020. All the need-to-know details will be communicated in their <a href="https://discord.gg/GMtnTZeHpr">Discord</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/deversifi">Twitter</a>. UPDATE: <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/nectar-liquidity-mining/">Learn more about Nectar Beehive V1</a>.</p>



<h1>DeversiFi offers a fast, smooth trading experience</h1>



<p>We recommend you <a href="https://www.deversifi.com/">experience it for yourself</a> to see how it compares to what you’ve come to expect from a DEX or even centralized exchanges. DeversiFi have recently added Hermez Network token offering a 10% kickback to the first 100 users who trade HEZ (<a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/hez-token-now-available-on-deversifi/">details here</a>). In the run-up to Nectar Beehive, various new token pairs will be added allowing Beehivers to trade their favourite tokens while earning NEC.</p>



<h2>High throughput and deep liquidity</h2>



<p>Why are rollups so cool? I’m glad you asked. I’m not going to get into all the technical details of how zkSTARKs or Validium rollups work. But in a nutshell, they allow DeversiFi to offer a super fast layer 2 experience while still rooting all security in layer 1, in this case the Ethereum blockchain. DeversiFi was the first DEX to utilize StarkWare’s transaction batching technology StarkEx which processes and settles trades at extremely high speeds (approx. 9,000 tps).</p>



<p>DeversiFi’s hybrid infrastructure features allows traders to tap into deep liquidity from aggregated order books including Bitfinex, resulting in self-custodial access to the best prices.</p>



<h2>Gas-Free trading</h2>



<p>No one likes paying high gas fees. They always seem to spike when you need to make an important trade. This typically happens because many traders are competing to “outbid” other traders to be included in the next block. <strong>DeversiFi users enjoy gas-free trading with instant finality</strong> thanks to its Validium rollups. Trades are processed in batches and securely submitted back to the Ethereum blockchain where customers’ funds are held. There is never any danger of trades being rolled back and rooting the transactions on-chain ensures customers would be able to withdraw their funds in the unlikely case where DeversiFi or StarkWare go offline.</p>



<p>Gas fees are only required to lock and unlock tokens; this is because these interactions take place with DeversiFi’s smart contract on layer 1.</p>



<h2>Privacy-by-default</h2>



<p>Don’t leak that sweet sweet alpha. Validium rollups is one of the only layer 2 technologies on the market that enables private transactions. Privacy let’s you make the most of opportunities in the market without exposing your strategy to the public blockchain where it can be monitored and reverse-engineered. And while leaking alpha is bad, your data potentially falling into more nefarious hands is worse.</p>



<p>Don’t underestimate the value of privacy when it comes to DeFi. Although the community is small now, DeFi is likely to grow into a wider mainstream market where bad actors may increasingly look to take advantage of personal data stored forever on the blockchain. As the saying goes: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>



<h1>DeversiFi’s roadmap aims to uniquely position the platform for the future</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/21xwQM4KCgKndacOHO9kIz_maga7Vzgs9-iIixBnsvt8iOB_yU7gblPBPY6sGC83NiaVwveE3PPmh-F10UeJ83-PPpop0dwIcGnn9LYmSeEGhGxWFR9btYjQRgp4Lr7g7rUpbL_C" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/deversifi-public-roadmap/"></a></p>



<p>Composability between platforms is the major game changer of DeFi. Within the next few months, DeFi is likely to experience an explosive growth in the number of protocols available on layer 1 in addition to the new and existing services migrating to layer 2. DeversiFi’s hybrid architecture and history of adaptation makes it uniquely situated to capitalize on the potential composability between layer 1 and layer 2 platforms as well as the opportunities that arise from bridging decentralized and centralized services like CEXs/DEXs.</p>



<p>Let’s discuss some features coming up on DeversiFi’s roadmap. Head <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/deversifi-public-roadmap/">here</a> for a full public roadmap.</p>



<h2>Rapid Withdrawals and DeversiFi EARN</h2>



<p>I haven’t met a person yet who enjoys the agony that is waiting for a withdrawal from an&nbsp; exchange. Previously, DeversiFi users would be required to wait until another batch of transactions is submitted to the blockchain in order to withdraw their funds. This can sometimes take a few hours depending on network congestion. With new rapid withdrawal functionality, DeversiFi users will be able to withdraw instantly, paying a fee and essentially “borrowing” liquidity from the DeversiFi EARN pool. Users can provide liquidity to DeversiFi EARN to earn fees for enabling rapid withdrawals. Both parties benefit from the arrangement: liquidity providers earn passive returns and traders have the option to skip the wait for a convenience fee.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conditional transfers open the door for enhanced composability</h2>



<p>Beyond fast withdrawals, conditional transfers open the door to many new possibilities and arbitrage opportunities for DeversiFi users. This upgrade would allow users to withdraw to new or different addresses, deposit from one address directly into their DeversiFi trading account, and it can even allow traders to make custom transactions directly interacting with other DeFi protocols on layer 1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can imagine how this lowers the opportunity cost of holding funds in DeversiFi. DeversiFi users benefit from being positioned to effectively seize potential opportunities across centralized and decentralized layer 1 and layer 2 DEXes, improving the overall efficiency of the market.</p>



<h2>Exploring synergies between DeFi and centralized services</h2>



<p>DeversiFi has been exploring a number of things that would further enhance DeversiFi’s hybrid architecture including zero-knowledge KYC and several regulatory licenses that would allow them to provide regulated products such as derivatives and leverage to even traders based out of the United States.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>DeversiFi has put a lot of time and effort into building a very uniquely situated trading platform. When you put all the pieces together, it’s easy to see DeversiFi and the Nectar community are dedicated to building a platform that is sustainable with long-term goals. Experience what layer 2 has to offer today by trading on <a href="https://www.deversifi.com/">DeversiFi</a>. And don’t forget to mark your calendar for the launch of <a href="https://beehive.nectar.community/#/beehive">Beehive</a>! Thanks for reading.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The DeFi Pulse Index is a digital asset index designed to track tokens’ performance within the Decentralized Finance industry. The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. <strong>As part of our </strong><strong>commitment to the ongoing maintenance and development of the DeFi Pulse Index, we are transitioning from v0.1 of our methodology to </strong><a href="https://pulse.inc/"><strong>DeFi Pulse Index Construction, Version 0.2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Version 0.2 introduces a change to the inclusion criteria that tokens must have a circulating supply minimum that is 7.5% or higher to ensure tokens have sufficient liquidity.</p>



<p>As outlined in v0.2 of its methodology, the DeFi Pulse Index is maintained in two phases: the Determination Phase and the Reconstitution Phase. The Determination Phase takes place during the third week of the month. During this phase, the circulating supply of each token currently included in DPI is determined. Any tokens eligible for addition or removal from DPI are also determined during this phase. Finally, new index weights, additions and deletions are incorporated into the index during the monthly Reconstitution Phase on the first business day of the month.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/07lr3Mkjtia8YKBoRCK7EuNm-z7c1LeZGef7gYtaGwHPVUu08o8uVwLrzN18lpvzIQWp96t-vQXeD3qjAU-05oo4M17GzpHOdR6Ja6dMtmGZurhwFiUXP9hhIHFLhjsp4q7H__0c" alt=""/></figure>



<p>DeFi tokens require adequate liquidity to be included in DPI. During our assessment, we found REP to have inconsistent liquidity. Liquidity is fractured across REP V1 and V2. As part of this month’s maintenance of DPI, REP will be removed from the DeFi Pulse Index as it does not meet the liquidity requirements for inclusion at this time. For information regarding inclusion criteria, see <a href="https://pulse.inc/">the DeFi Pulse Index Construction, Version 0.2.</a></p>



<p>In addition to the removal of REP, DPI has decreased its weighted allocations in MKR, YFI, KNC, REN, and LRC. DPI has increased its weighted allocation of COMP, SNX, AAVE, and BAL. <strong>DPI will be rebalanced as part of the Reconstitution Phase on December 1, 2020.</strong> You can also view more information about DPI and its underlying tokens on <a href="https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi">here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DeFi projects exist on a spectrum of decentralization. Trustlessness is at the heart of decentralization. But the word ‘trustlessness’ in itself is almost an oxymoron because trust is almost never eliminated from the equation but instead is simply shifted from one counterparty to another. The goal is to minimize the required trust in the pursuit of trustlessness. Even our most trustless examples of smart contracts still require a certain amount of trust that the blockchain infrastructure it is built on will continue to function properly. Additionally, there are internal economic and smart contract security risks in DeFi platforms themselves. Looking beyond that, DeFi platforms face external risks like composability with other protocols and even further out is oracle integrity and off-chain infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adding complexity typically comes with a wider attack surface for smart contracts. Many recent hacks have been caused by oracle manipulation. By simplifying the process of non-custodial asset management, you’re able to limit the attack surface of the average user. This is the guiding principle of DEXTF, permissionless non-custodial oracle-less fund management infrastructure. <a href="http://dextf.com/">DEXTF</a> enables digital-native funds where two parties, the portfolio manager and the investor, which are mutually distrusting of each other can cryptographically verify the status of the funds and enforce their rights directly through a digital wallet.</p>



<h1>What is DEXTF?</h1>



<p>DEXTF is an asset management protocol that allows anyone to create, mint, and redeem XTF funds. At present, DEXTF <a href="https://docs.dextf.com/documentation/faq/supported-tokens">supports 44 different assets</a> and funds are soft-limited to 10 tokens although this limit can be changed. The ticker symbol and asset weights are determined by the fund manager when creating the fund. Each XTF fund is an ERC20 token with its own address and contract allowing users to hold, trade, redeem and utilize XTF fund tokens like any other token.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-300x288.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8694" width="300" height="288" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-300x288.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-1024x985.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-768x738.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-1536x1477.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-2048x1969.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-1568x1508.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<h1>What makes DEXTF unique?</h1>



<p>The DEXTF team spotted a gap in the DeFi ETF space for an easy, accessible way for anyone to create and manage funds in DeFi. They sought to create simple and efficient asset management infrastructure that followed the team’s philosophy that only the bare minimum of logic should be on chain. DEXTF does not rely on oracles. The risk of manipulation present in complex oracle or rebalancing mechanisms tends to result in the use of admin keys in order to respond in a timely manner to attacks or exploits. The DEXTF team is skeptical that any protocol with these mechanisms can truly eliminate the need for these admin keys and subsequently the risk of capture these keys pose to the protocol. With DEXTF, there are no oracles to manipulate that can be used to steal or drain the fund; XTFs can only be minted with or redeemed for their underlying weight of tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DEXTF simply provides a permissionless way to mint new XTF tokens and relies solely on arbitrage and market forces for fund pricing. While only so much logic can be programmed into a smart contract, a community of properly incentivized stakeholders can be the strongest and smartest solution to many problems. Ultimately, reducing ETFs to their simplest form makes XTFs simpler to utilize in a way that is reminiscent of the highly modular design philosophy of UNIX. DEXTF can almost be thought of as a trust-minimized set of building blocks that creates economic incentives and opportunities for the community to be rewarded for taking up each role in the ecosystem.</p>



<h1>How the DEXTF ecosystem functions</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-coin-jigsaw-2@140x140-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8649" width="140" height="140"/></figure></div>



<p>Let’s break down the four roles in the DEXTF ecosystem to understand how they fit together to create highly liquid XTF token funds that are redeemable for their underlying assets. Investors, fund managers, and liquidity providers are eligible to receive ecosystem rewards for participating but we’ll cover that more later on. The team is also planning to add rewards for arbitrageurs.</p>



<h2>Investors</h2>



<p>Those looking to invest in XTF fund tokens can buy existing fund tokens listed on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. Alternatively, you can mint more XTF fund tokens by providing the underlying tokens although this costs more in gas fees. If you do not have them already, you can purchase the required tokens from Kyber right inside the <a href="https://dapp.dextf.com/">DEXTF interface</a> after selecting your desired fund. I recommend taking a look at DEXTF’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nU7ZrFqjWlPT1AYbdx4mYcT84wLy8jmv/view">video tutorials</a> to see how the fund investment process works.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://dapp.dextf.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_450-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8662" width="768" height="432"/></a></figure></div>



<h2>Fund Managers</h2>



<p>The process of creating XTF funds is designed to be simple and self-service. The idea is to promote decentralization by giving anyone the ability to freely and easily <a href="https://dapp.dextf.com/">create funds with idle tokens</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Anyone can create a fund in 4 easy steps:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Click the ‘Create Fund’ button and select your fund’s name and ticker symbol</li><li>Select which assets to include in your fund and the weight of each asset</li><li>Assign a risk rating and add a description to your fund</li><li>Finally, launch your fund on the blockchain</li></ol>



<p>Yet again, I recommend taking a look at DEXTF’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nU7ZrFqjWlPT1AYbdx4mYcT84wLy8jmv/view">video tutorials</a> to see for yourself how it works.</p>



<p>As of this writing, fund managers are currently able to choose from <a href="https://docs.dextf.com/documentation/faq/supported-tokens">44 different assets</a> with a soft limit of 10 assets wrapped around a single XTF token fund (this limit can be changed) but the DEXTF team plans to gradually expand the list of supported assets. You’ll even be able to create a fund consisting of other XTF fund tokens eventually. The DEXTF team also plans to continue adding new features like fund management fees and new asset types including real world assets such as equity, debt, and options.</p>



<h2>Liquidity Providers</h2>



<p>In order for new investors to be able to purchase XTF funds from a DEX, existing XTF fund token holders must provide liquidity. Fund managers and investors can take newly minted XTF tokens and create a pool on Uniswap to earn trading fees and liquidity mining rewards. Liquidity providers are important for ensuring smaller investors can efficiently enter and exit XTF funds while arbitrageurs are able to effectively take advantage of opportunities to drive XTF fund prices in the market.</p>



<h2>Arbitrageurs</h2>



<p>As previously mentioned, DEXTF’s oracle-less design relies on market forces to fairly price XTF funds. When the price of an XTF fund token differs from the value of its underlying assets, it’s up to arbitrageurs to seize the opportunity, balancing out price inefficiencies in the market. For example, an arbitrageur that spots an XTF token that is overvalued on Uniswap can provide the underlying tokens to mint and sell new XTF tokens. This action rewards the arbitrageur with profit for keeping the XTF fund properly priced and also pays trading fees to the pool’s liquidity providers. Arbitrageurs are vital to the DEXTF ecosystem because they indirectly provide price information to the protocol through their actions which eliminates the need for the oracle. To reward their participation, DEXTF is planning to provide ecosystem rewards to arbitrageurs soon.</p>



<h1>DEXTF Governance Token and Ecosystem Rewards</h1>



<p>DEXTF is an ERC20 token created to govern the DEXTF protocol. DEXTF tokens can be used to vote on proposals for potential protocol changes including the adjustment of system parameters like management fee factors or interest rate algorithms. DEXTF holders may also delegate their voting power to another address or delegate who may propose, vote on, and execute proposals on their behalf.</p>



<p>Additionally, the distribution of DEXTF tokens has been designed to reward network participants for performance, liquidity, volume and other interesting metrics in an effort to increase adoption of the DEXTF Dapp and XTF token funds.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hVAdkELzRHVejxtxsGI9rRL0GfjKZbQq9IA2jpw2sV-1fR-7CyNr4OdJ7ODtftRPn4QBzRHmTdkhqIQ2UuIunExFcexO9S9p4tzIPIINxjDDcQ1zaDEaO2KpbBsYUsD0hme14Grc" width="624" height="348"></p>



<h2>DEXTF Rewards</h2>



<p>DEXTF Rewards fall into three categories: Monthly Incentive Program (for Fund Managers and Investors), Milestone-based Incentive Program (for Fund Managers) and Liquidity Mining Incentive Program (for any user). These rewards are to be distributed over a 5 year period to encourage long-term adoption.<br><br>Users are eligible to receive DEXTF rewards for performing the following actions:</p>



<h3>Launch a new XTF fund token&nbsp;</h3>



<p>You can receive DEXTF tokens for launching new XTF fund tokens by selecting the underlying assets and relative weights. 17,000,000 DEXTF tokens or 17% of the total supply is reserved for monthly incentives for being one of the top funds, top new funds, and top performing new funds.</p>



<p>5,000,000 DEXTF or 5% of the total supply is set aside for Milestone Incentives, more specifically for the first funds to cross certain milestones. Learn more details about <a href="https://medium.com/dextf/intro-to-dextf-tokenomics-and-governance-aa0b620d959d">DEXTF incentives</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that when you take your idle tokens and launch your own fund, you’re competing to win a ratio of DEXTF rewards relative to the total. You can find the list of supported tokens <a href="https://docs.dextf.com/documentation/faq/supported-tokens">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Minting of XTF fund tokens</h3>



<p>You can receive DEXTF tokens for either minting XTF fund tokens via in kind contribution of the underlyings or through KyberSwap (except for tokens that are currently not supported by Kyber itself in which case a link to Paraswap will be provided to secure the missing tokens). 3,000,000 DEXTF or 3% of the total supply is set aside for Investors’ Monthly Incentives. The top 20 investors are eligible to receive a share of these rewards each month.</p>



<h3>Liquidity Mining</h3>



<p>You can receive DEXTF tokens for providing liquidity to the whitelisted Uniswap pools with XTF pairings. Out of the total  25,000,000 of all DEXTF tokens reserved for liquidity miners, 30% of it are reserved for the DEXTF/ETH pool LPs while the remaining 70% or 17,500,000 DEXTF are distributed across all other pools proportionally to the size of each pool in USDT terms. You can contact the DEXTF team at <a href="mailto:request@dextf.com">requests@dextf.com</a> to request a pool be whitelisted.</p>



<h3>Distribution Schedule</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="140" height="140" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-hourglass-coins@140x140.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8653"/></figure></div>



<p>Monthly Incentive Program rewards are streamed daily to a unique smart contract, starting from the end of term plus 1 day. Terms start on 15th of the month and ends on the 14th of following month. DEXTF liquidity mining rewards are streamed every block. Reward tokens are claimable in full only after 30 days. Liquidity providers receive a 10% bonus reward in DEXTF for staying for the full term.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say you started providing liquidity on November 15th and continued to do so for one month (so until December 14th), then you would only fully receive the rewards for that month of providing liquidity until January 15th, 2021.</p>



<p>See here for the <a href="https://medium.com/dextf/liquidity-mining-program-update-bca33057befe">latest update regarding the liquidity mining program</a>.</p>



<h1>What’s next for DEXTF?</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-saving-increase-2@140x140-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8651"/></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/dextf/what-are-structured-tokens-introducing-dexsts-b87474cba078">Decentralized Structured Tokens</a> (DEXSTs) are hybrid tokens with adjustable risk-return profiles, better suited to express non-linear market views. DEXSTs can utilize yield generating assets, derivatives, synthetics, and options from many different DeFi projects. Incorporating these sophisticated assets allows DEXSTs to take advantage of more opportunities in the market and allows their creators to adjust the risk-return profile to cater to a variety of market views.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Capital Protected Structured Token (CPST)</h2>



<p>The first Decentralized Structured Token (DEXST) is a <a href="https://medium.com/dextf/what-are-structured-tokens-introducing-dexsts-b87474cba078">Capital Protected Structured Token (CPST)</a> for ETH.&nbsp; As the name implies, Capital Protected Structured Tokens attempt to protect you from potential downside to your capital, ETH in this case, while maintaining exposure to the potential upside. CPSTs can be designed to be anti-fragile, suitable for any market conditions potentially performing best when the market is volatile in a range-bound market.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"> <img class="wp-image-8660" style="width: 140px;" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-bear-market-1@140x140-1.png" alt=""><img class="wp-image-8659" style="width: 140px;" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-bull-market-1@140x140-1.png" alt=""></p>



<p>The first iteration of CPST was launched in late September 2020. In the time since, the DEXTF team has worked with Opyn and UMA to incorporate feedback from the first iteration to co-build the next iteration of the primitive which could generate sustainable liquidity making it attractive to buyers. New CPSTs will be using UMA’s Zero-Coupon Bonds, a longer maturity version of the yield dollar, and a longer maturity Opyn call option with June 2021 expiry. The idea is to create a floor value of sorts for the underlying ETH but still allow investors to participate in any upside. So if you’re bullish but don’t want to remain fully exposed, CPSTs offer an efficient way to invest.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>The DEXTF team has built simple yet sophisticated fund management infrastructure that anyone can take advantage of to manage their portfolio. The permissionless and oracle-less design of DEXTF makes it highly scalable and resistant to capture or manipulation. DEXTF is also working in partnership with many prominent members of the DeFi community such as Opyn, UMA, Kyber, Ren Alliance, Set Protocol, and so many more to expand their already flexible set of components. All the necessary components and incentives are there for any community member to build or participate in an efficient ecosystem around digital-native funds and be rewarded for doing so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As you likely already know, MakerDAO’s DAI is a decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1 and backed by many different collateral types. Historically, there has been high demand for DAI causing it to rise above it’s $1 peg at times. To encourage the necessary inflation to bring DAI back down to $1, MakerDAO can add more collateral types and raise the total amount of DAI that can be minted from existing collateral types. While these changes do tend to bring DAI back on peg, they also add new risk parameters and complexity to the system. Some community members have raised concerns that these risks could compound over time, increasing the odds that DAI could become undercollateralized in a crisis and MakerDAO may be forced to trigger an emergency shutdown. If MakerDAO were to ever collapse, it would send ripples through the DeFi ecosystem due to the widespread use of DAI. <a href="https://hakka.finance/">Hakka Finance</a> built <a href="https://3fmutual.com/">3F Mutual</a> for this very reason so users could hedge against this economic risk with lower premiums and better market-making mechanisms.</p>



<p>Hakka Finance is an engineering team from Taiwan who have been building in the DeFi space since mid-2019. Currently, their two major products are 3F Mutual and <a href="http://blackholeswap.com/">BlackHoleSwap</a> (more on them in a bit), but the team has a history of building cool DeFi projects. The Hakka Finance team were finalists of the Kyber DeFi Virtual Hackathon in September 2019 with their <a href="https://devpost.com/software/crypto-structured-fund">Crypto Structure Fund</a> and also previously built <a href="https://github.com/Robin-and-friends/tCDP">a fungible version of CDPs</a> as well as <a href="https://hakka.finance/">other interesting projects</a>. Their stated goal is to build products that “allow users to pursue financial sovereignty.” The team plans to keep building until they’ve established a mature ecosystem of exceptional DeFi products controlled and governed by the community of HAKKA token holders. But before we dive too far into HAKKA, let’s explore their flagship product 3F Mutual to understand more about the Hakka Finance ecosystem.</p>



<h2>How does 3F Mutual work?</h2>



<p>Third Floor Mutual or <a href="https://3fmutual.com/">3F Mutual</a> is a rainy day fund designed to act as collective insurance against the risk of MakerDAO collapsing. You can purchase insurance from 3F Mutual to hedge against the economic risk of MakerDAO which can be claimed if the MakerDAO Emergency Shutdown Module is activated while your insurance is still active.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/D8VdEmKGHRdMvmH1PHp_ubO_KDnh1sd5Y688yISWn6P0IdBDwFIUcmowxdS2Y3taKCsrv25e3MqDptbNttByMd3W5Zc2Dk3TULp_lshAD_VKTP-7CArx2t2YNg5sSNGbPyvP_Chn" alt="" width="555" height="239"/></figure>



<p>3F Mutual uses an automated market maker (AMM) design which allows users to purchase insurance underwritten by 3F Mutual’s fund pool at any time. In a nutshell, there are three roles involved in 3F’s design: underwriters, insurance buyers, and insurance agents. Underwriters provide capital to 3F Mutual and earn dividends proportional to their share of the pool. As the name implies, insurance buyers pay insurance fees to receive coverage for a limited time. Insurance agents, as you may have guessed, refer new users to 3F and collect a referral bonus for doing so.<br></p>



<p>One key aspect of 3F’s design is that the insurance fees paid by insurance buyers becomes the pool used to compensate insurance buyers in the event MakerDAO’s emergency shutdown is activated. Additionally, underwriters receive dividends in the form of 15% of all insurance fees paid to the pool. When you buy insurance, you receive both insured units and shares of the pool. Shares, unlike units, never expire and entitle the holder to receive underwriter dividends. In this way, you’re acting as both an insurance buyer and an underwriter for the pool. You can even choose to buy 0-day insurance at the base price effectively purchasing shares with no insurance included.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/z08QP8psDlG5YMzrNtqtwqo_ab6c-PgOmZjUMDVcTkpHHcsQoU8FvJsRRIhiQyTlDYsaif24q0q7pxd7E_n9T1TidSMt0XH7T23YYZS79UCNj1leVbwUROhoa9hHKv-Kfo8NCnmt" alt="" width="437" height="118"/></figure>



<p>Every time you buy insurance from 3F you pay insurance fees based on the number of insurance units and how many days of coverage you want. The fee you pay when buying insurance is multiplied by a rate set to 100% per insured day with a 1% depreciation. In other words, you can get a discount if you buy longer insurance coverage. You can only buy a maximum of 100 days of coverage.</p>



<h3>Insurance Agents</h3>



<p>3F Mutual features insurance agents which allows users to earn referral fees. Anyone can spend 0.01 ETH to register a unique name in 3F Mutual to become the insurance agent. Agents can build a personal profile with a profile picture and opening statement powered by 3BOX and IPFS. Agents receive a bonus for every insurance purchase made with their referral link. Bonuses increase with more referrals in a tiered system. Learn more about <a href="https://3fmutual.hostedwiki.co/pages/In-depth%20tutorials">3F’s insurance agent system</a>.</p>



<h2>3F Mutual incentivizes early participation</h2>



<p>If MakerDAO’s emergency shutdown is activated, the total amount you’re eligible to claim is based on your number of active insurance units versus the total number of active units. When your units / coverage expires, you still keep your shares of the pool as an underwriter. With each new unit of insurance purchased, the base price per insurance unit rises and more fees are paid to the pool. As the pool continues to grow, 3F is able to provide larger amounts of insurance capacity which in turn further increases revenue. This positive cycle rewards early participants due to the fact that shares never expire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine you’re an early insurance buyer, you’d pay a smaller base price per unit/share than a future buyer and even after your insurance expires you’d continue to earn dividends as an underwriter. And since you receive the same number of shares as you do units purchased (even if you choose 0 days of coverage), the optimal strategy is to purchase short-term insurance in the early stages of 3F Mutual to maximize your dividends and then purchase more coverage right before MakerDAO would trigger an emergency shutdown. Of course, no one can predict if or when MakerDAO might trigger it with 100% accuracy. That’s why 3F can be thought of like a rainy day fund which produces dividends during sunny days.</p>



<p>Since its launch in mid-September 2020, 3F Mutual has already gotten a fair bit of traction. At the time of writing, there are currently ~1879 ETH in the pool, 5738929 total shares, 4519 active insurances, and 780 agents.</p>



<h2>How are 3F Mutual insurance fees distributed?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Destination</strong></td><td><strong>Percentage</strong></td><td><strong>Side note</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Dividends</td><td>15%</td><td>Equally distribute to all shareholders</td></tr><tr><td>IIP</td><td>10%</td><td>Reserve for Insurance Improvement Proposals</td></tr><tr><td>External</td><td>20%</td><td>Allocate to insurance agent (0~16%) and vault</td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>55%</td><td>Compensations for MakerDAO Emergency Shutdown</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><br>We already covered dividends, agent bonuses, and the pool of funds set aside for compensation, but that 10% for Insurance Improvement Proposals (IIP) is where 3F Mutual fits into the wider HAKKA ecosystem. This IIP reserve is held with 3F Mutual’s vault and is governed by HAKKA token holders. HAKKA holders vote on IIPs to determine how best to develop, maintain, or upgrade 3F Mutual’s protocol through Hakka Finance’s governance system.</p>



<h1>Hakka Ecosystem</h1>



<p>Hakka Finance aims to be a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), distributing HAKKA tokens to its community members in order to decentralize governance. HAKKA tokens were originally sold to cover the team’s development costs when the market turned bearish in 2019. At present, 60% of all HAKKA tokens are being distributed to the community via liquidity mining and other incentive programs.<br><img loading="lazy" alt="Image for post" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5jQMvll3P79uGBSIMdCtxMrM7JBL4TJd1RvAdsXxeCeIJEpW8Tf9Riztbcr0Gb_-RtNdnIAm2kybrG4RF1EiV8uV6YTZ5mZuAICdzBz2I_McbpQbqijM85zrhqurCnwc78dZLDPI" width="624" height="307"><br>The Hakka Finance team is committed to transparency providing the community with a <a href="https://medium.com/hakkafinance/hakka-finance-transparency-report-e75f025507dc">Transparency Report</a> and <a href="https://hakka-finance.gitbook.io/hakka-wiki/governance/governance-roadmap">Hakka’s governance roadmap</a>. In an <a href="https://medium.com/hakkafinance/financial-statements-of-hakka-finance-646674369a3d">updated financial statement from Sept. 2020</a>, Hakka Finance mentions that a significant portion of the total supply was burned and locking / vesting schedules were extended.</p>



<p>HAKKA token holders <a href="https://beta-gov.hakka.finance/#/">govern various parameters in Hakka Finance</a> products, like the IIP reserves mentioned. HAKKA governance also determines when to add <a href="https://medium.com/hakkafinance/hakka-reward-pools-v8-af51937ac068">new liquidity mining incentives</a>. Users can <a href="https://rewards.hakka.finance/pools">earn HAKKA tokens</a> by providing liquidity for purchasing insurance on 3F Mutual in addition to providing liquidity for HAKKA and BlackHoleSwap, Hakka Finance’s stablecoin DEX.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>BlackHoleSwap</h1>



<p>Created in July 2020, <a href="http://blackholeswap.com/">BlackHoleSwap</a> is a decentralized stablecoin exchange that can process transactions far exceeding its existing liquidity by tapping into lending protocols. BlackHoleSwap’s name is inspired by its goal to have the deepest liquidity in the universe. BlackHoleSwap leverages excess supply to borrow the necessary stablecoin when reserves are inadequate to perform a swap, lowering slippage and maximizing capital utilization. This adds what the Hakka team refers to as “virtual liquidity” to popular AMM models like Uniswap. Given the same amount of “real reserves,” BlackHoleSwap produces less slippage than many other DEXes and can even have “real reserves” as little as 0.<br><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZXhfK-ufRY_SwGojTSU8VDd2FkG2_PK2cLAihGZ-Hma5QTDuOOb1qcbAvLJ-HMwHBIRcg1XlaBenbzBbdnG8LXRLGdOYroRQpn3k0Vn8EzZ9VamOGY1KSklDXL58qnpRgFyk1TO_" width="624" height="391"></p>



<p>And because it is integrated with Compound, BlackHoleSwap can even mine COMP for the pool producing extra profit for liquidity providers. To learn more about the technical details behind BlackHoleSwap, I recommend you read the wiki found <a href="https://hakka-finance.gitbook.io/hakka-wiki/hakka-products/black-hole-swap-bhs">here</a>.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>Between <a href="https://3fmutual.com/">3F Mutual</a> and <a href="https://blackholeswap.com/swap">BlackHoleSwap</a>, the Hakka team has built interesting products with innovative features uniquely catered to the DeFi space. I’d argue they live up to their catch phrase of “Warped Spacetime with Crypto Native Primitives” because some of their features are a bit mind-bending. Given their track record, I’ll be eagerly awaiting whatever comes next from Hakka Finance.
