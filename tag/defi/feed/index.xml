<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Welcome! We&#8217;re glad to have you back for another Founder Fireside Chat. This week, we sat down with Robert Lauko, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://defipulse.com/liquity">Liquity</a>, whose work aims to push the bounds of decentralization.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In contrast to other stablecoins and CDP platforms, Liquity is optimized for making borrowing as attractive as possible. It achieves this by replacing interest rates with a very low, one-time fee (most of the time only 0.5%) paid upfront on the borrowed amount and by only requiring a collateral ratio of 110%. This makes borrowing LUSD very capital efficient, cheap for medium to long term loans, and particularly interesting for leverage seekers. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Liquity also has a unique approach to handling liquidations. In other systems, under-collateralized positions are usually resolved through lengthy collateral auctions. Liquity replaces these auctions by pooling together capital (i.e. LUSD) upfront from users wishing to buy liquidated collateral effectively at a ~10% discount. We call this mechanism the Stability Pool. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Lastly, as a result of its radical approach to immutability, Liquity is also completely algorithmic, with the system being able to auto-adjust to external circumstances like a peg break.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In a strict sense, <strong>security is the most important since an unsecure system is flawed even if it’s scalable or decentralized, while centralized and unscalable systems can have legitimate use cases. </strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For building a highly dynamic application like Liquity with its redistribution mechanism, we had to go miles to work around Ethereum’s scalability issues. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">On the other hand, we are pushing the concept of decentralization by not running an official frontend and by making the protocol fully immutable. But without being secure, these features would mean nothing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In order to form a lasting community that sticks with your product or service, you need to make sure that you can offer sustainable value in the long run rather than just temporary benefits. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>While yield farming opportunities are great to attract early adopters, it is crucial to keep delivering long term utility regardless of the market conditions. </strong>Furthermore, you need to make sure that your users and community members have easy access to the team and that their questions, concerns, and ideas are heard.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Most of the focus has been on decentralizing the backend, i.e. the smart contracts, while few projects have tried to decentralize their frontends too.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> IPFS and Arweave are interesting in this regard, but they are detached from the platform (e.g. Ethereum) that is hosting the backend. With DFINITY’s Internet Computer, it will become possible to seamlessly decentralize the backend and the frontend using the same technology stack. With their recent launch, they’ll be worth keeping an eye on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Over the last 1.5 years it became clear to me how important it is to build a team that is motivated, shares the same principles, and is aligned with the vision of the project. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>When people are committed to a common goal and working together as a group, they can create incredible results. </strong>Outsourcing tasks to third parties and companies turned out to be much more challenging and less successful in my experience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">DeFi is becoming more and more popular among the real farmers <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> So the farming memes are my favorite.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">This week in this installment in our Founder Fireside Chat series, we talked with Nour Haridy, Founder of <a href="https://defipulse.com/inverse">Inverse Finance</a>, about not settling for the conventional approach.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I&#8217;m one of many others building Inverse DAO and its ecosystem of DeFi products. I&#8217;d say what sets us apart from others is that we tend to try unconventional solutions to difficult problems. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For example, we started off by launching a non-tradable governance token and seized free riders tokens in order to increase governance participation. We combined money markets, stablecoins and synthetic assets into a single protocol (Anchor) in an attempt to increase the capital efficiency of all these products together. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Regarding smart contract risk, we resorted to public community reviews as an alternative to the corporate auditing industry. Basically, we&#8217;re about trying new things and having fun.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Security. No point trusting your assets to a blockchain that has a track record of being insecure (e.g. Ethereum Classic).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I wouldn&#8217;t consider myself an expert on the matter, but I&#8217;d say that it helps to have a strong common interest. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In the case of DeFi protocols, that can be a protocol that the community wants to work together to grow.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Many DeFi protocols seem to try to replicate products from TradFi which results in products that inherit the same inefficiencies. </strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In my opinion, <strong>synthetic assets are very under-explored</strong> and are our best chance at creating entirely new financial products that resemble nothing we&#8217;ve seen before.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The biggest competitive edge in this space is not having a life.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color has-very-light-gray-color is-style-wide"/>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">While we at DeFi Pulse can&#8217;t recommend not having a life, we would like to take a moment to thank you for reading. And thank you Nour for joining us.

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Welcome back! This week we had the opportunity to speak with Itamar Lesuisse, CEO and Co-Founder of <a href="http://argent.xyz/">Argent</a>. Itamar shares his unique perspective coming from the team behind Argent, one of the most popular DeFi smart contract wallets.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Argent is entering an extremely exciting phase. We&#8217;re about to release a big update to our Layer 1 wallet, tailored for people with $50K-$1m plus who need smooth access to DeFi. Essentially it&#8217;s a multi-sig when you want, not when you don&#8217;t. Control and convenience. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Then, this summer, we&#8217;re launching a Layer 2 wallet to make a major push for crypto mass adoption. We&#8217;ll start by using zkSync but will expand beyond that over time. It will be simple, secure, fast and low cost.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The trilemma forces you to think very carefully about first principles and why you&#8217;re actually building. What are you trying to achieve? For who? That then shapes what trade-offs you&#8217;re willing to make. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For us, we believe Ethereum will be the foundation of a new, global financial system that expands economic opportunity. <strong>Of course that needs scalability, but without security and decentralization it would be built on sand</strong>, so we&#8217;re prioritizing those (while pushing for scalability wherever it doesn&#8217;t conflict with those).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It&#8217;s too early for us to say if we&#8217;ve achieved this but we&#8217;re trying to build a durable community by making it truly participatory and not transactional. It&#8217;s not about us broadcasting to an audience but instead about hearing what people think and responding to that. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Being a liquidity provider in DeFi has typically been associated with opportunity costs and risks, particularly the always dreaded risk of impermanent loss. As a liquidity provider, it is important to familiarize yourself with the concept of impermanent loss and determining when the risk to reward ratio is right. But the truth is you have options aside from accepting impermanent loss as an inevitability, you could explore what’s possible with <a href="https://impermax.finance/">Impermax</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Impermax set out to build what they refer to as the “missing piece of the AMM puzzle,” a protocol which allows users to maximize their AMM liquidity pool (LP) tokens. With Impermax, anyone can create a lending market for Uniswap (and soon to be other) AMM LP pairs. Liquidity providers can utilize their LP tokens as collateral to borrow tokens or leverage/multiply their AMM LP positions. Impermax allows users to put LP tokens to work which were once idle leading to more complex strategies and potentially ecosystem growth spurred by increased productivity.</p>



<h2>Maximize the productivity of your AMM LP tokens</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><a href="https://impermax.finance/"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/impermax-blog-thumb-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9190" width="300" height="300"/></a></figure></div>



<p>As previously mentioned, Impermax is <a href="https://impermax.finance/a-lending-market-designed-for-the-lp-tokens-of-uniswap-and-other-amms/">a lending market designed for liquidity pool tokens</a> of Uniswap and other AMMs. Let’s examine how this works behind the scenes. As a borrower, you must first deposit your LP tokens to use as collateral before being able to borrow or leverage. Impermax takes the LP tokens provided as collateral and allows users to borrow the underlying tokens in the LP pair. Interestingly, lenders can choose to lend one or both of the tokens in a LP pair to earn interest without any exposure to impermanent loss. Impermax refers to this as lndirect Liquidity Providing because lenders are basically earning a percentage of the trading fees that borrowers earn but without any impermanent loss.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that lending pools are isolated to each LP token pair and loans are 100% backed by the tokens inside the LP token pair held as collateral. The Time-Weighted Average Price or TWAP provided by Uniswap is used to calculate the liquidation prices of loans to ensure loans remain 100% collateralized. This is kind of cool because it enables Impermax users to permissionlessly add new Uniswap LP tokens and start a lending market for any LP token pair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Borrowers can choose to borrow either token in the pair individually for a unique strategy or simply borrow both to obtain leverage for their desired LP position. Impermax provides an easy to use interface which simplifies the process of leveraging LP tokens up to 10x to a single transaction. Impermax has a liquidity mining program which rewards users with <a href="https://impermax.medium.com/impermax-tokenomics-34cb3dd66474">IMX tokens</a> for borrowing select token pairs. Since your rewards are based off of borrowing, you can actually multiply your liquidity mining rewards by leveraging select token pairs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/borrowable-collateral-infographic.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9191" width="340" height="312"/></figure></div>



<h2>Use caution when operating power tools</h2>



<p>As with all things in DeFi, nothing is without risk. We’ll be discussing some here but as always we encourage you to do your own research. Luckily, Impermax has a very nice <a href="https://app.impermax.finance/risks">risks section </a>to aid you in your due diligence. Like most lending markets in DeFi, it’s possible that you may temporarily be unable to withdraw tokens as a lender if the lending pool has insufficient liquidity like in the event of a “bank run.” Although it should be noted that the dynamic interest rates are designed to alleviate these issues eventually. And of course, if you borrow or leverage, you face the potential risk of liquidation if you don’t meet collateral requirements.</p>



<p>You should also be aware that the permissionless nature of Impermax lending pools is a double-edged sword that carries unique risks. Since anyone can add a new AMM LP token pair and create a lending market, anyone can add new pairs even if they have low liquidity or are potentially malicious. Luckily, these risks are isolated to individual AMM LP token pairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, Impermax relies on Time Weighted Average Prices from the AMM. This means that if a pair is inactive for a long period of time, the price of the oracle may differ substantially from the market price. Additionally, an inactive pair may not attract enough liquidators to insure loans are liquidated in time which can result in a possible loss for lenders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>You can never quite tell which direction the DeFi community will run with an idea but the writing is on the wall that liquidity providers want more out of their LP tokens. Impermax has designed their product to cater to the needs of these liquidity providers in a permissionless way similar to the AMMs themselves. This is enabled by Impermax’s practical and prudent decision to isolate risk to individual lending pools. Builders don’t have to ask for permission to whitelist their project’s AMM LP pair and can even permissionlessly incorporate Impermax lending pools at a protocol level.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a borrower looking to leverage your LP tokens or a lender looking to earn some extra yield from indirect liquidity proving, you should explore <a href="https://impermax.finance/">Impermax</a> available lending pools today. If you’re unsure or just want to take a test drive, you can test Impermax’s application at no cost on Ropsten testnet with zero risks.

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Injective-Header-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9029" width="1024" height="512"/></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To kick off our Founder Fireside Chat series, we speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/ericinjective">Eric Chen</a>, Co-founder of <a href="https://injectiveprotocol.com/">Injective Protocol</a>, who is working to bring unparalleled access to new decentralized derivatives markets with restrictions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Injective Protocol is the first fully decentralized exchange protocol that unlocks the full potential of decentralized derivatives and borderless DeFi. Injective Protocol enables fully decentralized trading without any restrictions, allowing individuals to trade on any derivative market of their choosing. A few unique features set us apart from the rest. We are devoid of any and all gas fees, which means no one has to pay the ridiculously high gas fees that currently plague the Ethereum ecosystem. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition, we enable a higher level of interoperability given our integration with the Cosmos network. We are also an orderbook model exchange with instant finality, so traders are able to trade more freely without having to worry about slippage and other issues on DEXs today. Our scaling infrastructure also allows us to scale Ethereum-based transactions with composability with the greater DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would have to go with decentralization. <strong>If we sacrifice decentralization, we&#8217;re no better than the legacy CeFi infrastructure.</strong> As a result, I think that this is the most important aspect that sets apart blockchain-based systems from other platforms.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I believe decentralized derivatives hold tremendous promise. In traditional finance, <strong>this sector encompasses literally quadrillions of dollars</strong>. If DeFi can capture even 1% of this market, it would tremendously help accelerate the adoption of crypto-based networks as a whole.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Due to the technical nature of our team and origin, we started off Injective with an overly complicated structure that proved to be unsustainable in the long run due to its engineering challenges. <strong>What we&#8217;ve learned is that we should take Occam&#8217;s razor approach when it comes to product focus and development.</strong> This way we can provide a clear avenue and value proposition for new traders to access our ecosystem. This is why we built a user-friendly frontend that helps to abstract away the decentralized infrastructure, leading to an exchange that can be adopted globally.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Recent events have made it all too clear to the average user why decentralization has a key role to play in having a fair and efficient market. Futureswap aims to disrupt the multi-billion dollar perpetual futures trading market currently dominated by centralized services. Futureswap takes a different approach with a hybrid between Uniswap and a perpetual futures exchange platform governed by the community. You may remember Futureswap from their <a href="https://medium.com/futureswap/futureswap-lessons-learned-from-a-3-day-alpha-be4e37bc8c52">successful Alpha in April 2020 which ultimately ended early</a> after DeFi users flocked to the platform in overwhelming numbers. In less than 3 days, Futureswap’s Alpha 24hr trading volume grew to $17M and liquidity passed $1M. Erring on the side of caution, the Futureswap team decided to end the Alpha earlier than initially planned.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Now they’re back with something even better, the Futureswap V2 Beta is </strong><a href="https://futureswap.com/"><strong>already launched on mainnet</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The Futureswap V2 Beta includes upgrades like live pricing and higher capital efficiency which aim to provide a perpetual futures trading experience that outperforms <em>centralized</em> exchanges.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="494" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-1024x494.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8860" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-1024x494.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-300x145.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-768x370.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-1536x741.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-2048x988.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/COL_DG-1568x756.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>What makes Futureswap V2 Beta special?</h2>



<p>Futureswap is a decentralized exchange platform with an automatic market maker (AMM) design that enables traders to enter leveraged perpetual futures with low slippage. Its automatic market maker (AMM) design provides higher capital efficiency offering up to 10x leverage. According to Futureswap: after $50m in liquidity, Futureswap should have better price execution for a $1m trade than any other decentralized exchange and after $300m it has the lowest slippage compared to centralized exchanges based on the current slippage parameters. </p>



<p>Additionally, Futureswap pools can be very efficient with their use of capital resulting in more stability and potentially high returns for liquidity providers compared to traditional AMM exchanges. Futureswap utilizes what’s called a Dynamic Funding Rate or DFR for short. The DFR is a borrowing fee based on the total trade size designed to maintain the volume balance between open longs and shorts. During times of disproportionate demand, liquidity providers’ pooled assets are used to take up the opposite side of any unmatched trades. So if there were tons of unmatched ETH longs, LPs cover the ETH essentially opening a short.</p>



<p>Long and short volumes are pooled and then the more popular pool is charged the dynamic funding rate and it’s paid to the pool in low demand.<strong> </strong>This mechanism limits extreme volatility and properly rewards liquidity providers for their exposure to risk. The DFR keeps increasing as the disparity grows to disincentivize trades on the popular side. In other words, the longs pay the shorts or vice versa until the sides become balanced. This also means that liquidity providers have the potential to earn more thanks to the DFR.</p>



<h3>Oracle Relayer Network (ORN)</h3>



<p>One of the biggest improvements Futureswap V2 brings is the new Oracle Relayer Network (ORN) which enables instant pricing and real-time trading. ORN has been described as a mesh between a price oracle and a meta-transaction processor node. Futureswap users are able to trade in real-time by signing a message including their order and submitting them to ORN. Then, ORN verifies the signed message and finalizes the trade on-chain at the current price. Transactions will fail if outside accurate price bounds set by ORN to protect users. The Futureswap team is taking further steps to improve the Oracle Relayer Network’s security with audits by <a href="https://www.trailofbits.com/">Trail of Bits</a> and plans to add more nodes to the network.</p>



<h2><br><strong>How Futureswap works</strong></h2>



<h3>Traders</h3>



<p>As we’ve covered, <a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/">traders on Futureswap can open long or short perpetual future positions with up to 10x leverage</a> in real-time with instant pricing. Perpetual futures on Futureswap have no time limits and can remain open as long as the trader has enough collateral. Traders will either pay or earn the dynamic funding rate when opening longs or shorts depending on whether they are on the popular side of the trade or not. Traders also earn FST token rewards each epoch based on their percentage of close trade volume that distribution period.<br></p>



<h3>Liquidity providers</h3>



<p>Liquidity Providers<a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/pool"> add liquidity to Futureswap pools</a> in equal parts to earn trading fees and FST token rewards. For example, if you wanted to add liquidity to Futureswap’s ETH/USDC pool, you would need $100 worth of ETH and 100 USDC. Once deposited, LP tokens are minted representing your share of the pool. These LP tokens can be redeemed at any time if their liquidity is not in a trade. Liquidity providers earn trading fees for allowing traders to use their liquidity. Liquidity providers also earn FST token rewards as an incentive to further grow Futureswap’s available liquidity.</p>



<h3>Liquidators</h3>



<p>Liquidators monitor the platform for positions that are close to violating margin requirements and send liquidation transactions to close at-risk positions for a liquidator fee. It’s vital to the health and stability of the platform for positions to be reliably closed once they reach their liquidation price. It’s worth mentioning that submitting these transactions does not require the liquidator to provide any value or to take over the trade. They simply close the trade on behalf of the protocol and are rewarded for doing so. Currently, the percentage that liquidators receive is 30% of the remaining collateral up to a maximum (currently set to 500 USDC).</p>



<h2>Futureswap is governed by the community</h2>



<p>FST is Futureswap’s non-transferable governance token which is<a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/rewards"> rewarded to traders, liquidity providers, and referrers each day.</a>&nbsp; FST allows the Futureswap community to propose and vote on changes to the protocol, enabling it to evolve and improve over time. We’ve already mentioned FST tokens a few times covering Futureswap’s various incentives designed to incentivize user participation. <a href="https://medium.com/futureswap/futureswap-governance-token-distribution-d2712c855da5">FST is used to reward the Futureswap</a> users contributing to the growth and adoption of the platform. And since Futureswap is governed by the community, this gives the most active users influence over the future of the platform. In other words, users who participate sooner rather than later after the community grows even larger are more likely to have a larger impact with their contributions and receive more FST rewards.</p>



<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>



<p>Potentially disrupting such a big market like perpetual futures presents an opportunity for Futureswap. Futureswap is designed with the expectations of serious trades in mind. Futureswap’s design with its high capital efficiency and low slippage lends itself well to larger trades for whales and industry traders. Its instant pricing and real-time trading ORN system provides a better trading experience with built-in protections against front running attacks. Futureswap may also continue to provide even lower slippage as liquidity grows over time. FST rewards increase the likelihood of this occurring by incentivizing adoption.</p>



<p>Try <a href="https://www.futureswap.com/">Futureswap</a> today and start earning FST rewards. Also, be sure to check out the Futureswap community on <a href="https://twitter.com/futureswapx">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/ZCcxtu9VxH">Discord</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many would argue that generating yield with stablecoins is currently one of DeFi’s biggest use cases. So it’s no wonder we’ve seen a flurry of different stablecoins, yield aggregators and vaults entering the market, each with their own tokenized representation of yield-bearing stablecoins. You can almost picture these yield-bearing tokens like snowflakes; each similar at a glance but entirely unique when examined closely. When snowflakes are combined they become an indistinguishable mass that can be shaped to create something more like a snowman or igloo. Whether you prefer to look at protocols and tokens like snowflakes or money legos, there are undeniable benefits to combining and layering different DeFi protocols to create something new. This is precisely the logic behind <a href="https://snowswap.org/">SnowSwap</a> which aims to be the defacto way to swap yield-bearing assets like stablecoins, tokenized BTC, ETH2 staking tokens and other similar assets.</p>



<h2>What is SnowSwap?</h2>



<p>Imagine you have USDC deposited into yEarn’s yUSDC vault but you notice you could be earning a higher yield using yDAI. You could pay the gas required for all the transactions to withdraw your USDC, convert it to DAI, and then re-deposit your DAI into Yearn or you could save yourself the hassle and use SnowSwap. <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/snowswap-bringing-liquidity-to-stablecoin-yield-farming-12e222af0462">SnowSwap</a>, based on Curve’s AMM model, allows users to easily enter and exit yVaults and other yield bearing tokens for only the cost of a swap fee. Increasing liquidity for similar yield-bearing tokens makes it easier for users to speculate on their yield or performance. SnowSwap’s first pools, <a href="https://snowswap.org/iearn/">yVault USD</a> (yDAI, yUSDC, yUSDT, yTUSD) and <a href="https://snowswap.org/busd/">yVault Curve</a> (yUSD, ybCRV), were focused on yield-bearing stablecoin tokens. It didn’t stop at stablecoins though; the <a href="https://snowswap.org/pusd/">btcSNOW pool</a> (YcrvRenWSBTC, FcrvRenWBTC) features yield-bearing tokenized versions of BTC from yEarn and Harvest Finance.</p>



<p>The next step in SnowSwap’s journey went even further by introducing a new pool called <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/%EF%B8%8Fbuilding-on-2-0-with-eth2snow-and-sharedstake-partnership-%EF%B8%8F-5ca251f8e1a0">eth2SNOW</a> designed to incentivize Eth2 adoption. SnowSwap’s <a href="https://snowswap.org/ethsnow/">eth2SNOW pool</a> aims to create new markets and utility via the ability to enter, exit, and swap between popular eth2 staking services with low slippage. This pool includes vETH2, aETH by ANKR, CRETH2 by CREAM, WETH. eth2SNOW provides a few key advantages for users:</p>



<ul><li>Enables users to conveniently enter and exit Eth2 staking services using WETH</li><li>Allows users to optimize for the highest APY % with low slippage swaps</li><li>Alleviates minimum ETH entry required for aETH</li><li>Liquidity providers gain exposure to Eth2 staking and earn a portion of swap fees</li></ul>



<p>In general, providing liquidity to SnowSwap’s pools provides a simpler and more cost effective way to gain exposure to a basket of yield-bearing assets with the added benefit of receiving a portion of swap fees. When a user provides liquidity to a SnowSwap pool, they receive either ySNOW, ycrvSNOW, btcSNOW, eth2SNOW tokens depending on the pool. Liquidity providers can stake these tokens to earn additional yield in the form of SNOW, SnowSwap’s governance token. 80% of the total SNOW tokens will be distributed to SnowSwap liquidity providers via liquidity mining rewards designed to bootstrap liquidity as well as the SnowSwap community.</p>



<h2>Progressing towards decentralization with The Snow DAO</h2>



<p>The SnowSwap team envisions The Snow DAO to play an important role in the future of SnowSwap. In this vision, <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/f-k-making-it-rain-were-making-it-snow-e60b64ad1292">SNOW</a> would grant users the ability to vote on governance proposals to modify or add to the SnowSwap protocol. For example, a future proposal could be voted in that distributes swap fees to SNOW holders. Nonetheless, the SnowSwap team<a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/snow-whats-next-29639c181732"> also believes </a>that poorly executed token governance can slow down the growth of a protocol. For this reason,&nbsp; they want to explore the possibilities with the community and collaborate to forge a path towards decentralization together. For example, one idea floated by the SnowSwap team was having community-based executives. In the meantime, the SnowSwap team covers the cost of development via the 10% of SNOW given to the Dev Fund on a 3-year vesting schedule. Additionally, 8% of SNOW was issued to the SnowSwap Foundation, a treasury used to fund initiatives and incentivize the growth of the ecosystem such as security audits, partner programs, and grants.</p>



<h3>Growing the SNOW community with positive-sum feedback loops</h3>



<p>At its core, SnowSwap is exploring the possibilities of forging symbiotic relationships leveraging the positive-sum nature of DeFi. Its pools provide liquidity between tokens staked in various DeFi protocols, creating a market to swap these tokens which had previously been so fragmented and illiquid. This encourages users to engage with these tokens and in turn creates additional utility for their respective communities. Members of these communities who use SnowSwap, earning them SNOW rewards, then also become members of the SnowSwap community. You can probably see where this leads… the more projects SnowSwap provides utility to, the more the communities grow, and so on to form a positive sum feedback loop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In line with this positive-sum mentality, The SnowSwap Foundation will invest in initiatives and teams which add value to the SnowSwap ecosystem. This strategy referred to as ‘Offensive Forkability’ supports community experimentation and encourages innovation. For example, grants could be funded to explore protocol design experiments. The goal of this strategy is to create network value by collaborating with SnowSwap to disincentivize vampire attacks. In other words, the strategy embodies the phrase: “If you can’t beat them, join them.”</p>



<h2>So what’s in store for SnowSwap?</h2>



<p>SnowSwap is keeping busy between new partnerships and crossing community milestones. The self-proclaimed army of “White Walkers&#8221; continues to grow with recently launched dedicated communities for its SnowSwap users in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India. <a href="https://twitter.com/Quantstamp/status/1343744581007933440?s=20">Quantstamp reviewed SnowSwap’s contracts</a> clearing the path to more major partnerships. Meanwhile, the eth2SNOW pool made in partnership with ANKR now has over 1000 ETH tokens. And now, it’s been<a href="https://twitter.com/snow_swap/status/1353059315968479232"> announced</a> that 1inch is integrating SnowSwap’s liquidity pools. SnowSwap pools will likely see increased trading volume from DEX aggregators and earn more trading fees for liquidity providers as a result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the sound of it, there’s even more brewing behind the scenes. SnowSwap told us that they have 5 major partners that they plan to reveal in the near future. So don’t be surprised to see new potential pools, tokenized assets and/or other developments coming soon. To be the first to hear about these new partnerships, we recommend you follow SnowSwap on the platform of your choice: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/CSSJTs4">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/Snow_Swap">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/snow_swap">Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already, we recommend you go <a href="https://snowswap.org/">check out SnowSwap</a> and see how its low slippage AMM design can offer you more convenience and utility.<br><br><br><em>Disclosure: This post is part of our paid promotional DeFi Pulse Drop series; We’ve partnered with SnowSwap to help educate and inform the community about their protocol.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In traditional finance, leaner banking models without physical locations allowed online banks to cut costs and pass the benefits onto the customer. Banking services built on decentralized networks like Ethereum can offer even more advantages by further reducing operational costs such as securing assets which would traditionally be held in custody. Non-custodial protocols like DeFiner allow users to access savings and loans anytime, anywhere with an internet connection putting you in control of your money.</p>



<p><a href="https://definer.org/">DeFiner</a> is a non-custodial protocol which aims to be a better banking experience than traditional banks by making full use of the disruptive innovations happening in DeFi. Since its founding in 2018, DeFiner has gone on to <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/79450/definerorg-wins-detroit-fintech-challenge/">win the Detroit Fintech Challenge in August 2019</a> and participated in the <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/announcing-the-inaugural-class-of-techstars-hub71-accelerator">Techstars Accelerator</a> and Microsoft Startup Program. Partnerships with both names from traditional tech firms like Microsoft and Consensus Labs as well as names from DeFi like Wyre and Kyber have helped DeFiner move closer towards its goal. DeFiner envisions a complete range of DeFi banking services starting with its first two products: peer-to-peer lending and DeFi savings.</p>

<h2>DeFiner’s Taurus savings takes advantage of existing money legos</h2>



<p>DeFiner <a href="https://blog.definer.org/taurus-launch">launched Taurus Savings Accounts</a> in late November 2020. Taurus Savings Accounts work similar to DeFi money markets you’re likely familiar with. You can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow against your collateral. While loans on the DeFiner protocol are overcollateralized, DeFiner takes advantage of existing DeFi protocols to offer its users borrowing and lending interest rates typically better than the industry average. You see DeFiner takes a portion of the collateral held in its reserves and lends it out on popular money markets like Compound or Maker to earn interest. In other words, DeFiner increases capital utilization to up to more than 85% to reduce the spread between borrowing and lending rates. </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that while this does indeed lower the spread, it comes at the cost of added composability and economic risks. Imagine a scenario where the value of a collateral asset drops quickly or a bug is found and exploited and Compound is unable to cover existing debts. This in turn may mean DeFiner could also be left with insufficient collateral unable to cover existing debts.</p>



<p>When things don’t go as planned, DeFiner allows borrowers to pay back their loans with their collateral. Triggering a self-liquidation sells your desired collateral at a 2% discount in order to cover your debt and avoid a forced liquidation, which bears a 5% collateral discount. Both discounted rates are designed to attract liquidators to participate in collateral auctions and ensure debts can reliably be covered in a timely manner.</p>



<p>DeFiner protocol uses its native token FIN to reward its most active users as well as incentivize users to help meet demand in highly sought after lending markets like USDC and DAI. DeFiner protocol releases new FIN tokens via its Proof of Premium (POP) distribution mechanism. Proof of Premium verifies the premium the prover (lenders and borrowers) generated in a specified time interval. To sum up POP, the more capital committed by a user for longer time periods and higher interest rates results in more FIN tokens being rewarded through the POP mining mechanism. FIN token holders can vote on the follow four categories: lending platform changes (i.e. loan to collateral value ratios, transaction fees, etc.), determining how platform fees are distributed, determining the distribution of FIN token rewards, and electing the board of directors for the DeFiner Organization, a non-profit entity which maintains and promotes the growth of the DeFiner lending platform and community. Currently, 100% of transaction fees and 10% of all interest generated by loans on the DeFiner protocol are distributed to FIN token holders. Learn more about FIN token and Proof of Premium <a href="https://github.com/DeFinerOrg/whitepaper/wiki/DeFiner-Whitepaper#definer-token-fin-economy">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>Decentralized finance has been a series of innovations each one building on the next. That’s why it’s nice to see DeFiner exploring ways to utilize secondary money markets to improve its own money market for the benefit of its users. DeFiner plans to release a mobile app in the future. With the ever increasing popularity of mobile banking, this feels like a natural progression of DeFiner’s mission to reduce friction for users. <a href="https://twitter.com/definerorg">Follow DeFiner on Twitter</a> to keep up with the latest updates. And if you’re curious how DeFiner’s design impacts interest rates, we urge you to check out <a href="https://app.definer.org/">Taurus</a> and compare it to other popular lending platforms.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There’s no doubt that 2020 was a wild ride for everyone, especially for anyone involved in DeFi. When you look back at the year, it’s honestly hard to wrap your head around how much things have changed in our community. There are so many projects that launched this year that have become core to the foundation of decentralized finance. Many new projects rose to fill the needs of the ecosystem and many more challenged our preconceived notions of what was thought possible or where DeFi was headed at the start of the year. To round out the year, we thought it would be best to take a moment to celebrate the Top Builders in DeFi of 2020 as nominated by you in our first ever community survey. </p>



<h2>Top Builders in DeFi of 2020</h2>



<p>Without further ado, here are the results:<br><br>Andre Cronje won DeFi&#8217;s MVP builder, engineer, and top project lead of 2020. Fellow YFI proponent Banteg came in second for the top engineer in DeFi of 2020.<br><br>Argent won the top UX/UI of 2020 with honorable mentions going to both DeFi Saver and Synthetix.<br><br>Ryan Sean Adams won DeFi&#8217;s top communications lead of 2020.<br><br>Anthony Sassano won DeFi&#8217;s top community manager of 2020.<br><br>As many guessed, Samczun won DeFi&#8217;s top white hat hacker and top auditor of 2020.</p>



<p>Kudos to all of you and your hard work! DeFi wouldn’t be what it is today without your contributions!<br><br>Now on a more personal level, we’d like to highlight the ways we here at DeFi Pulse have grown in 2020.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Adapters</h2>



<p>It feels like forever ago that we released the <a href="https://github.com/ConcourseOpen/DeFi-Pulse-Adapters">open source adapter framework</a> that now powers our metrics on the DeFi Pulse leaderboard in February 2020. In the past, we had to learn each project and code their adapters ourselves. This new framework allowed projects to collaborate with our team making the listing process faster and ensuring TVL metrics were measured accurately. This year alone we more than doubled the number of projects on DeFi Pulse, listing close to 40 new projects in 2020 (not including any updates to existing projects): <a href="https://defipulse.com/aave">Aave</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/alpha-homora">Alpha Homora</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/auctus">Auctus</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/balancer">Balancer</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/b.protocol">B.Protocol</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/c.r.e.a.m.-finance">C.R.E.A.M.

<h2>Setting new records for Total Value Locked (TVL)</h2>



<p>The total value locked (TVL) in DeFi grew exponentially during 2020. With more than $14B TVL currently, this was a year of massive growth across all DeFi categories. We saw the birth of dozens of new projects, the emergence of new ways of distributing ownership to the community, the consolidation of open orgs as a novel coordination system, and massive technological experimentation that brought tremendous innovation to DeFi. One can&#8217;t help but wonder what DeFi&#8217;s growth will be in 2021 and what new innovations we will witness. But one thing is for sure, though: these are still very early days, and we&#8217;re only beginning to see what the future of finance will look like.</p>

<p>It seems hard to believe that we were celebrating that the <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/1-billion-tvl-in-defi/">(TVL) had hitted the $1B</a> mark for the first time less than one year ago.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Data</h2>



<p>In April 2020, we<a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/see-the-bigger-picture-with-defi-pulse-data/"> released</a> <a href="https://data.defipulse.com/">DeFi Pulse Data</a> combining DeFi Pulse’s popular metrics with data from Concourse Open’s other popular services’ APIs like <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/">ETHGasStation</a>. Whether you’re writing a blog post analyzing DeFi or building an application that needs accurate gas prices from ETH Gas Station, any task benefits from the right information. We’ve been thrilled to see what the community has done with our data at their disposal.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Drops</h2>



<p>We launched DeFi Pulse Drops, a promotional series where we partnered with projects to inform the community about their latest features, releases, and builds. All in all, we provided in-depth analysis of the following projects throughout 2020: <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/futureswap/">Futureswap</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/balancer-start-liquidity-mining-and-earn-bal-tokens-today/">Balancer</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/mcdex/">MCDEX</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/introducing-mstable/">mStable</a>, Rari Capital <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/rari-capital/">v1</a> and <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/rari-capital-v2/">v2</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/aco/">Auctus</a>’s ACO, Akropolis’s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/delphi/">Delphi, Perpetual Protocol</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/lien/">Lien</a>, Hakka’s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/3f-mutual/">3F Mutual</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dextf/">DEXTF</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/deversifi-nectar-beehive-v1/">DeversiFi</a>, and <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/harvest-finance-drop/">Harvest Finance</a>.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Farmer</h2>



<p>This year’s most important trend within the DeFi space was, without a doubt, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/the-yield-farming-frenzy-and-its-impact-on-defi/">yield farming</a>. Ignited by the launch of the COMP governance token in June, farming developed into one of the key strategies most projects relied on to attract capital to their platforms. By distributing ownership of their protocols to the DeFi community via liquidity incentives in the form of governance tokens, projects grew the liquidity of their platforms exponentially, making the TVL break all-time highs consistently during most weeks of Q3 and Q4.<br><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZmckhJ5sGa2qwaeDds0vUdEHjjJvKk1Rx1Fh4mK4frzcfO42WtTjPBbHMCTTkCjenkiOFIe2ImQKiCVd1I_Jwo3xrhjlP3W7cw6SCJzEl8EA_-6_Pz0i6Wo1PZjpsmZr--tl_-oS" width="624" height="112"></p>



<p>In early August, we launched the <a href="https://yieldfarmer.substack.com/">DeFi Pulse Farmer newsletter</a> to extensively cover this massive trend and get to the heart of the most critical innovations in the space. Currently at edition #21, DeFi Pulse Farmer also offers premium subscribers access to the Alpha Tractor and Protocol Express series. You can <a href="https://yieldfarmer.substack.com/subscribe?utm_source=menu&amp;simple=true&amp;next=https%3A%2F%2Fyieldfarmer.substack.com%2F">sign up to DeFi Pulse Farmer here</a>.</p>



<h2>DeFi Pulse Index</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi">DeFi Pulse Index</a> (DPI), a capitalization weighted index built on Set Protocol’s V2 infrastructure consisting of the most popular DeFi tokens available on Ethereum was<a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-pulse-index/"> launched in September 2020</a>. DeFi Pulse Index was the first of its kind, an index of decentralized finance that wasn’t synthetic or a derivative but rather you own the underlying DeFi tokens and can redeem them using your DPI. Much like our Total Value Locked (TVL) metrics, we aimed to make DeFi Pulse Index a standard the community could stand behind. At the time of writing, DPI is the leading DeFi index token with 5769 holders and a market capitalization of over $25M.</p>

<h2>DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade</h2>



<p>In October 2020, the <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/introducing-the-defi-pulse-economic-safety-grade/">DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade was released in partnership with Gauntlet</a> and added to <a href="https://defipulse.com/compound">Compound</a> and <a href="https://defipulse.com/aave">Aave</a>’s project pages on DeFi Pulse. As the name implies, each Economic Safety Grade is a 1 to 100 grade that allows users to more easily quantify and compare the economic risks of using on-chain protocols. Grades are created by running simulations utilizing data from centralized and decentralized exchanges combined with on-chain user data to estimate market risks. For a more in-depth explanation of the simulation model, we recommend you read this <a href="https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/understanding-risk-in-defi-f64574593979">blog post from Gauntlet</a>.</p>



<h2>Bitcoin at Work</h2>



<p>Marking the last major release for DeFi Pulse in 2020, our team <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/introducing-bitcoin-at-work/">unveiled a new page </a>highlighting the use of Bitcoin in the DeFi ecosystem called <a href="https://defipulse.com/btc">Bitcoin at Work</a>. We worked with 10 different teams from all across the industry to support a wide variety of BTC tokens at launch including: WBTC, RENBTC, HBTC, sBTC, tBTC, imBTC, oBTC, acBTC, pBTC, and BTC++. Thanks again to the team’s who coordinated with us on this launch. Aside from recognizing the hard work and growth of this sector, we hope the metrics and information included in this new page will help DeFi users discover new possibilities and make more informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Thank you to each and every one of you reading this. With all the flashy numbers and tech, it can be easy to forget that DeFi begins and ends with the people that make up this community. There would be no value, liquidity, or any other metrics to measure without the time and attention each one of us dedicates to building a brighter future together. Our team’s resolution for 2021 is to keep working with project communities to highlight the awesome work being done in this space with the platform we’ve been given by you. Thanks for reading and have a happy new year.</p>

<p>Over the course of 2020, more than 140,000 BTC entered the DeFi ecosystem. With so many different alternatives for Bitcoin tokens, it only makes sense to break it out into its own page to provide more detailed metrics. We&#8217;re excited to introduce a new page highlighting the use of Bitcoin in the DeFi ecosystem. <a href="http://defipulse.com/btc">Bitcoin at Work</a> measures the total amount of BTC being utilized within decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>

<p>We worked with 10 different teams from all across our industry to bring you a wide variety of BTC token metrics. <strong>The following BTC tokens will be included at launch:&nbsp;WBTC, RENBTC, HBTC, sBTC, tBTC, imBTC, oBTC, acBTC, pBTC, and BTC++.</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-1024x512.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8785" width="768" height="384" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-1024x512.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-300x150.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-768x384.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<p>As you might have noticed, WBTC has been moved to this new page and its TVL is no longer included in the TVL metrics found on our homepage. WBTC was originally added to the leaderboard at a time when it was practically the only tokenized BTC utilized in DeFi, but given the current landscape we now think it is a better fit for the Bitcoin at Work leaderboard.</p>



<p>We know that not every BTC token is quite the same. Each one has its own method of minting and redeeming and varying degrees of centralization ranging from custodial to fully decentralized.<strong> </strong><br><strong>We broke down each BTC token into four types to better distinguish their different qualities:<br></strong><br><strong>Decentralized</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held within a fully decentralized protocol<br><br><strong>Custodial</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held in custody by a third party<br><br><strong>Synthetic</strong> &#8211; a token which follows the price of Bitcoin but is not directly backed by BTC<br><br><strong>Hybrid</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held within an open protocol transitioning towards decentralization</p>



<p>Aside from recognizing the hard work and growth of this sector, we hope the metrics and information included in this new page will help DeFi users discover new possibilities and make more informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Special thanks to all the teams for working with us! Be sure to check out the new page and explore the <a href="http://defipulse.com/btc">Bitcoin at Work</a> metrics for yourself. And if you’re interested in joining the DeFi Pulse Leaderboard, please check out this <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-to-join-the-defi-pulse-leaderboard/">step-by-step guide.</a></p>
