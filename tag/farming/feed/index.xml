										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alpha Homora was a DeFi product born out of practicality. Those familiar with DeFi can tell you that users will go to extraordinary lengths when they spot an opportunity. This proved to be especially true as the yield farming craze reached a fever pitch in 2020 when users would combine various lending protocols to leverage yield farming opportunities. It wasn’t long before <a href="https://alphafinance.io/">Alpha Finance Lab</a> spotted this gap in the market and created Alpha Homora to give users a better way to yield farm with leverage more efficiently while also attempting to minimize the risks involved.</p>



<p>Alpha Homora V2 builds on the popular Alpha Homora V1 yield farming product, supporting more AMM protocols, including Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap, allowing yield farmers to borrow various assets in addition to ETH, and enabling leverage of up to 9x leverage thanks to new partnerships.<strong> </strong><a href="https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/"><strong>Alpha Homora V2</strong></a><strong> is set to launch on Feb 1st.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-1024x549.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8843" width="768" height="412" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-1024x549.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-300x161.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-768x411.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<h2>How does leveraged yield farming work?</h2>



<p>Manually yield farming with leverage required you to take out and manage loans across several lending platforms in what amounted to a nerve-wrecking position that could be extremely hard to ‘unwind’. Using <a href="https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/">Alpha Homora V2</a> is a lot simpler and helps minimize the risks involved (though <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/risk">nothing is risk-free</a>). First, you select a supported liquidity pool from popular exchanges like SushiSwap, Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve that are on Alpha Homora v2 and then supply either or both of the tokens to your desired pool. For example, if you choose the SushiSwap&#8217;s ETH/USDC pool that is on Alpha Homora V2 you can provide ETH, USDC, or both. Note, you don’t need to have equal value of both tokens in order to yield farm with Alpha Homora V2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, you’ll decide whether or not you want to use leverage (which goes up to 9x for selected pools). And then, follow the prompts to confirm and submit your transaction and <em>viola </em>Alpha Homora automagically handles the rest. Users can borrow multiple assets, re-leverage, and deleverage their positions easily in just a few clicks. Compared to doing this process by hand, Alpha Homora can <em>feel like magic.</em> It’s easy to see where the name comes from.</p>



<h1>What’s new in Alpha Homora V2?</h1>



<p>Strong partnerships have shaped the design of Alpha Homora V2. Many of you may have noticed that V2 allows yield farmers to take advantage of significantly more leverage than its predecessor. Behind the scenes, Alpha Homora V2 utilizes CREAM V2’s liquidity to take on leverage for its users. Sometimes referred to as The Iron Bank, CREAM V2 allows whitelisted partner protocols like Alpha Homora V2 to take out loans with less collateral requirements. This results in more leverage for Alpha Homora’s yield farmers and higher interest rates for CREAM V2 users.<br></p>



<p>Alpha Finance Labs worked closely with its partners to enable leveraged yield farming of liquidity pools on Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap. And in an effort to help strengthen its partners’ communities, Alpha Homora V2 will not automatically sell and reinvest the farmed tokens. <strong>At launch, Alpha Homora V2 will feature the following leveraged farming pools:</strong></p>



<p><strong>New leveraged pools:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Curve’s 3pool (USDT, USDC, DAI)</li><li>Balancer’s PERP/USDC</li></ul>



<p><strong>Pools migrated from V1:</strong></p>



<ul><li>SushiSwap’s ETH/SUSHI</li><li>Uniswap’s ETH/UNI</li></ul>



<p>In a nutshell, farmers will be able to leverage USDT, USDC, DAI, and ETH to farm CRV, PERP, or SUSHI tokens with up to 9x leverage. On the flipside, lenders will be able to lend ETH, USDT, USDC, and DAI on day one to start earning interest. The plan is to continue to add even more new pools and migrate more pools from V1 over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those curious, be sure to check out these fantastic posts written by the Alpha Finance team that walks you through Alpha Homora V2 from the perspective of <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-in-yield-farmers-perspectives/">yield farmers</a> and <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-in-lenders-perspectives/">lenders</a>. Alpha Homora is also offering additional yield in the form of ALPHA rewards for both farmers. See <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/liquidity-mining-part-2a">here</a> for more information.</p>



<h2>Migrating to V2</h2>



<p>To ensure a smooth transition, ALPHA rewards will continue for a limited time for those liquidity mining on Alpha Homora V1. Although farmers should be aware that leveraged positions on Alpha Homora v2 will get more rewards compared to those on V1. This creates an incentive to migrate sooner rather than later. Here’s <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/72-hour-countdown/">a step-by-step guide</a> for those looking to migrate.</p>



<h2>What is ibETHv2?</h2>



<p>When you lend out an asset on Alpha Homora, you receive the corresponding ibToken or interest bearing token. ibETHv2 is an interest-bearing ETH token you receive when lending ETH to Alpha Homora V2. Alpha Homora typically has competitive yields for ETH due to the high demand from its leverage yield farming pools. Alpha Finance Lab also runs a <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/trading-volume-mining-part-2b">Trading Volume Mining</a> program which rewards users for supplying liquidity to ibETH/ALPHA and ibETHv2/ALPHA pools.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/o7JpNF2vwiZxUlXbPbEtUtMMlbqUwQM-KpKE5OSCqCYH0jEBrzXPKlkjlCp1E7fk5JD8rQx5sGaQqQaShoaL1BF8_FuqNWS_yV7z5qzmfbBNjFw_L6otv5Yzlfeo2yw2RYBZgEsm" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The ibETHv2/ALPHA pool on SushiSwap <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/72-hour-countdown/">goes live on Feb 3rd</a>. Liquidity providers of this pool will receive ALPHA rewards as well as SUSHI tokens from SushiSwap’s Onsen program. Rewards from Alpha Finance’s Trading Volume Mining program will be reflected in the form of trading fees APY when you remove liquidity (not airdropped to your wallet). Those providing liquidity to the ibETH/ALPHA pool on Uniswap will still receive rewards until Feb 3rd, 1pm UTC.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>Alpha Finance Lab’s initial release of Alpha Homora was well-received by the DeFi community given the immediate utility it provided to yield farmers. Alpha Homora V2 built on this popular platform to provide more utility for its users and value for its partner protocols. Key partnerships like the utilization of CREAM V2’s Iron Bank will allow Alpha Homora V2’s users to achieve higher levels of capital efficiency. It’s undeniable we’ve entered a new era in DeFi where partnerships can give you an edge more now than ever. So it will be very interesting to see how such a deep protocol level partnership influences the future growth of both platforms. Regardless of how things pan out, Alpha Homora V2 users will reap the benefits in the meantime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the introduction of yield farming two months ago, DeFi has been growing at breakneck speed. Total Value Locked (TVL) has <a href="https://defipulse.com/">increased 5.6X and reached its all-time high of $6.77B</a>. New protocols, platforms, and new investment opportunities are launched week after week, making it hard to keep up even for the most sophisticated users in the space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This exponential growth has made it increasingly complex for users to efficiently select the best yield farming opportunities while reducing their exposure to risks. And it is even harder for inexperienced users who are looking to have exposure to DeFi protocols. These users don&#8217;t know where to start due to the complexity of these systems, and the lack of a single product that can help them make informed decisions without diving into multiple Twitter threads, blog posts, Discord groups, and complicated platforms.</p>



<p>Here is where <a href="https://delphi.akropolis.io/summary">Delphi</a> comes in.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is Delphi?</strong></h2>



<p>Delphi is an easy to use platform that allows users to automate their DeFi lives. Their platform offers curated access to different yield farming opportunities across DeFi, by providing non-technical users with a clean and simple UI to help them take advantage of them.</p>



<p>Through its platform, users have access to different investment options depending on their risk appetite. These options are presented as Savings, Investments, DCA (dollar-cost averaging), and Staking. Delphi is built by the Akropolis team and is the second product after <a href="https://sparta.akropolis.io/">Sparta</a> built on the <a href="https://github.com/akropolisio/akropolisOS">AkropolisOS</a>.</p>



<p>Only the Savings option is available, but the Investments, DCA, and Staking options will soon go live, as well. For a full view of their releases schedule, you can <a href="https://www.notion.so/b390a85d87124796b0b008b20e6ab38e?v=387bc54a16e34bf2b8f7328b839eebc2">check out Akropolis&#8217;s roadmap here.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>The two most exciting options that can be accessed through Delphi are the &#8220;Savings account,&#8221; and “DCA” options:</p>



<h3><strong>Savings account</strong></h3>



<p>The Savings account option provides users with a value proposition similar to that of traditional finance products, in which users can access products that offer predictable returns at low costs. The key difference here is that Delphi manages allocations across a wide array of stable coin DeFi pools in different protocols to take advantage of yield farming opportunities. In this way, Delphi offers higher APYs, while canceling volatility and exposure to impermanent loss.</p>



<h2><strong>DCA&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The DCA option brings a much-needed feature to the DeFi space that has been traditionally offered by centralized exchanges: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">dollar-cost averaging</a>. DCA gives users a straightforward way to gain exposure to assets by reducing the impact of volatility on the overall purchases.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How does Delphi work?</strong></h2>



<p>Delphi seeks to lower the barrier to entry for the least experienced DeFi users and be a compelling tool for experienced users at the same time. To achieve that, it offers a straightforward and intuitive interface. The “Savings” &amp; Staking” options will be the first to go live on August 24th. So we will focus on the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option and on how to leverage it to make the most out of your investments.</p>



<ol><li>First, remember that to use the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option, you must own stablecoins such as DAI, USDC, or sUSD.</li><li>Once you have stable coins in your wallet, go to the <a href="https://delphi.akropolis.io/">Delphi website</a>, click on the right-hand side top corner on the &#8220;App&#8221; button, and connect your wallet when the pop up requests you to do so.</li><li>Once your wallet is connected, you&#8217;ll be ready to start using the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option.</li><li>When clicking on the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option, you will select among one of five pools in which to allocate your stablecoins and create your savings account. Starting tomorrow, you will be able to pick among any of the following pools:<ul><li>Compound DAI pool</li><li>Compound USDC pool</li><li>sUSD Curve pool</li><li>Y Curve</li><li>bUSD Curve pool</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>Pools have an option called &#8220;View Pool Details,&#8221; where you can click to find out the details about each pool and compare them to decide in which one to invest your savings. &#8220;View Pool Details&#8221; shows the total liquidity and asset weight, daily volume, gas costs, and, most importantly, the pools&#8217; APY and the approximate weekly rewards that will be received in each of the tokens awarded in each pool.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XfWoxhKABSnqAXAm3oYLetwE8qZ1_1Vf25Nv4Rw_Ux4mplgdxKJIxXLpkpPJUHyvvdAzRV7s8sPYpUE8BNwKAHb3AxCeBFRB3GmOEEiuNTGkg-tfhI83H8nLpC7DLXud9jhxrGLJ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Once you make up your mind, you can invest your savings in a single pool by clicking on the &#8220;Allocate&#8221; option in each pool. But you can also diversify among two, three or more pools by clicking on the &#8220;Allocate&#8221; option on the bottom right-hand corner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wXZBLNX8tVNhz81dJjqiMciJFOaD7PWBw4DIHMzdlChYsIXnJsqZ8Q2dmhbbm4MgmRvx2ESfZbWx0yhfzv1FkSFSSkmVirl7ZCF1OPzZjKLd31bsLVvbd3ts4vpQjobdDOL5ndzy" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The &#8220;Allocate&#8221; option is one of the coolest features of the Delphi &#8220;Savings&#8221; option. It allows you to diversify your savings by investing in more than one pool by performing one single transaction, at lower costs than making a separate investment in each pool by accessing different protocols.</p>



<p>As for the Staking, it’s a simple supply of liquidity to the AKRO-only pool at the moment. In the future, this section will be expanded &amp; include Akropolis governance pools for Akropolis products.</p>



<p><strong>Bonus (coming soon): </strong>with Delphi, you can also rebalance your allocation between pools in one single transaction.</p>



<p>Finally, once you have allocated your savings in one or more pools, you can track all of your investments by clicking on the &#8220;My Summary&#8221; option, which allows you to track all of your pools, APYs &amp; harvest in one place.</p>



<h2><strong>Delphi Governance</strong></h2>



<p>The Delphi platform will be governed by holders of the ADEL governance token, which will be minted over six months after its mainnet launch. In a very similar fashion to YFI, ADEL will not have a pre-sale or pre-mine. It will only be earnt through liquidity provision of stablecoins, AKRO, and other selected tokens and active governance participation, and just 5% will be reserved for development, audits &amp; other costs.</p>



<p>The most important parameters will be the following:</p>



<ul><li>ADEL is not just a governance token — it will have a shared claim on Delphi&#8217;s future fees (exit/entry fees, performance fees, exchange referral fees, etc.).</li><li>60,000,000 ADEL will be minted as fixed supply and distributed linearly over six months. Community governance will have the option to amend the ADEL monetary policy to introduce inflation/deflation/elasticity of supply.</li><li>95% goes to active users/LPs, including community rewards [unlocked from week 2].</li><li>5% goes to development, maintenance, and audit.</li><li>A product governance DAO will be created before or shortly after full mainnet launch.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/akropolis/august-2020-akropolis-monthly-update-part-1-of-n-a51f265073a9">You can learn more about AKRO, Akropolis governance token, and ADEL, in this blog post.</a></p>



<h2><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>As DeFi continues to grow exponentially and more protocols and platforms continue to launch weekly, complexity across the space will also increase. Even the most sophisticated users will start struggling to keep track of all the different investment opportunities and new systems in this scenario. This is where platforms such as Delphi come in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By solving all the complexities in the background and providing a clean UI for any user to easily invest, rebalance, and monitor their allocations, Delphi provides a very compelling value proposition that can make any user comfortable with interacting with DeFi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is also exciting that the governance token distribution that Delphi will pursue puts the users of the protocol first and will allocate 95% of all minted tokens to the community.</p>



<p>Open your Savings account on Delphi tomorrow, or learn more about them by heading to <a href="https://delphi.akropolis.io/">their website</a>. You can also <a href="https://www.notion.so/b390a85d87124796b0b008b20e6ab38e?v=387bc54a16e34bf2b8f7328b839eebc2">check out their roadmap</a> and be on the lookout for all the upcoming releases.</p>
