										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Liquidity is paramount to the growth of DeFi. Many DApps require reliable pools of liquidity to function. One of the most interesting project&#8217;s innovating in the pool liquidity space is Balancer. If you haven&#8217;t heard of Balancer, now&#8217;s a great time to learn because Balancer is about to start distributing BAL tokens to liquidity providers on June 1st, 2020 at 00:00 UTC. We&#8217;re working with Balancer Labs to get the word out about this Liquidity Mining process as part of our DeFi Pulse Drop series.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8278" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>What is Balancer?</h2>



<p>Balancer is a non-custodial generalized automatic market maker (AMM) protocol that launched in March of this year. Yes, that&#8217;s a mouthful but it&#8217;s easy to understand once you break it down. You&#8217;re probably familiar with AMM exchange models like Uniswap, but where Balancer differs is the fact it&#8217;s generalized making it suitable for all sorts of needs, but more on that in a bit.</p>



<h3>Balancer pools are like self-balancing index funds</h3>



<p>Anyone can create a Balancer pool and add liquidity to the protocol. However, what makes Balancer pools so unique is that you aren&#8217;t restricted to pools with the typical 50/50 split between two tokens we&#8217;re used to. Balancer pools support up to 8 tokens with custom distributions. For example, a pool could be 30% WETH, 30% MKR, and 30% USDC, and 10% LINK while another pool is 80% WETH and 20% DAI. </p>



<p>Balancer uses smart order routing (SOR) to route users&#8217; trades to the pools that combined provide the best rate possible. Essentially, Balancer pools are like self-balancing index funds but instead of charging you fees you actually get paid for contributing your liquidity.</p>



<h3>Different pools for different needs</h3>



<p>As previously mentioned, Balancer liquidity pools are highly flexible and can be optimized for specific use cases. Balancer Labs has even released templates for new innovative pool designs. Take for instance <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/building-liquidity-into-token-distribution-a49d4286e0d4">Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools</a> (LBPs) that communities can use to build deep liquidity for their token. Or even, <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/zero-impermanent-loss-stablecoin-pool-with-lending-interests-a3da6d8bb782">stablecoin pools with zero impermanent-loss</a>.</p>



<h2>Balancer Protocol Governance Token (BAL)</h2>



<p>Balancer V1 initially launched with no native token; this latest update to Balancer introduces the Balancer Protocol Governance Token (BAL). BAL holders will determine the future of Balancer protocol, making decisions like implementing new features, potential protocol fees, or even bigger picture plans like whether to use layer 2 scaling and/or deploy contracts on other blockchains. </p>



<p>Out of the total supply of 100M BAL tokens, 25M were initially allocated to founders, core devs, advisors and investors and are all subject to vesting periods. The remaining 75M BAL tokens will be mostly distributed to users who provide liquidity to Balancer pools in a process called <strong>liquidity mining</strong>. </p>



<h2>Liquidity mining &#8211; Earn BAL on top of pool returns</h2>



<p>For a protocol like Balancer to remain decentralized, the governance process also needs to be decentralized. And, it only makes sense for those that use the protocol the most to be given a voice in said process. This is exactly what Balancer&#8217;s liquidity mining aims to do. </p>



<p>Each week, 145k BAL will be awarded to users with liquidity in Balancer pools, totaling 7.5M BAL per year. The idea is to create a really strong incentive for early adopters grow liquidity and get involved in the governance process.</p>



<p><strong>Starting on June 1st, 2020 at 00:00 UTC (which is tonight if you&#8217;re reading this Sunday May 31st), those currently providing liquidity to Balancer protocol will be eligible to receive BAL tokens.</strong> So now&#8217;s your chance to <a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/">add liquidity or create a new pool</a> to reap the benefits of being that early adopter.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;All liquidity providers will receive Balancer Protocol Governance Tokens as long as a USD price can be extracted from CoinGecko for at least 2 tokens present in their liquidity pools. Liquidity from tokens without such USD price is not eligible.&#8221;</em></p>



<h3>Earn BAL on top of pool swap fees</h3>



<p>Every Balancer pool has its own customized <em>pool swap fee</em>; whenever someone performs a trade that utilizes the pool&#8217;s liquidity, this fee is distributed equally to that pool&#8217;s liquidity providers. So when you provide liquidity not only are you earning this fee, but you&#8217;re also earning BAL </p>



<h3>Liquidity mining encourages lower pool fees</h3>



<p>One of the coolest parts of liquidity mining is that it&#8217;s designed to incentivize pools to have low pool swap fees. The USD value of each pool&#8217;s underlying tokens according to CoinGecko is multiplied by what&#8217;s called a <em>feeFactor</em> to determine how many BAL the pool is eligible to receive. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="621" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-1024x621.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8277" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-1024x621.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-300x182.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-768x466.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x.png 1362w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As you can see in the chart above, the higher the fee, the lower this feeFactor is, and the less BAL tokens that pool&#8217;s liquidity providers receive each week. The logic is that pools with lower fees pull in more users willing to trade on Balancer and so these pools should receive greater rewards. Personally, I think it&#8217;s a clever way to optimize Balancer to achieve lower fees while still rewarding liquidity providers accordingly.</p>



<h2>Don&#8217;t miss out. Liquidity mining starts soon.</h2>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried it yet, there&#8217;s never been a better time to consider <a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/">adding liquidity to existing pools or creating your own pool</a>. <strong>Starting tonight Sunday 31st (June 1st, 2020 at 00:00 UTC to be precise), those currently providing liquidity to Balancer protocol will be eligible to receive BAL</strong>. Not only will you earn BAL, getting involved early is also a great way to ensure Balancer works best for you, implementing changes you want to see as a stakeholder in the protocol.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you ask me, the most exciting part of decentralized finance is seeing DeFi&#8217;s money legos stacking up over time. Futureswap, launching Monday afternoon PST (April 20th, 2020), is a great example of how decentralized finance iterates on past successes to evolve into something even better.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0"><img loading="lazy" width="2488" height="1168" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8166" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1.png 2488w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-300x141.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-1024x481.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-768x361.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-1536x721.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-2048x961.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/ROW-DG_1-1-1568x736.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 2488px) 100vw, 2488px" /></a></figure>



<h2>Futureswap is like a blend of Uniswap and BitMEX</h2>



<p><a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0">Futureswap</a> is a decentralized automated market maker (AMM) perpetual futures platform where users can trade any ERC20 token with up to 20x leverage. These perpetual futures have no time limits and can remain open as long as the trader has enough collateral.</p>



<p>Similar to Uniswap, users deposit equal parts of token and stablecoin (i.e. ETH/DAI) and are issued ownership shares of the liquidity pool. With Futureswap, users can enter long or short leveraged future positions which are matched by liquidity pools. </p>



<p>But here&#8217;s where things get interesting:<strong> Futureswap has zero slippage for any size trade and 100% pooled assets can be utilized.</strong> Liquidity providers can earn trade trading fees and borrowing fees on up to 100% of their deposits. And so, Futureswap pools can be very efficient with their use of capital resulting in more stability and potentially high returns for liquidity providers compared to traditional AMM exchanges.</p>



<h3>Dynamic Funding Rate (DFR)</h3>



<p>Futureswap has a unique mechanism called the dynamic funding rate or DFR for short. The DFR is a borrowing fee based on the total trade size designed to maintain the volume balance between open longs and shorts. During times of disproportionate demand, liquidity providers&#8217; pooled assets are used to take up the opposite side of any unmatched trades. So if there were tons of unmatched ETH longs, LPs cover the ETH essentially opening a short.</p>



<p>Long and short volumes are pooled and here&#8217;s the kicker: <strong><strong>the more popular pool</strong> is charged the dynamic funding rate and it&#8217;s paid to the pool in low demand. </strong>The DFR keeps increasing as the disparity grows to disincentivize trades on the popular side. In other words, the longs pay the shorts or vice versa until the sides become balanced. This mechanism limits extreme volatility and properly rewards liquidity providers for their exposure to risk.</p>



<p>So what are the risks for liquidity providers if worse comes to worst and 100% of the traders are short and the price decreases? Liquidity providers essentially have the same exposure as if they were holding 100% of the token instead of 50% token and 50% stablecoin. While it&#8217;s still a risk, the dynamic funding rate lowers the likelihood of such a situation happening.</p>



<h2>Incentives designed to benefit all involved</h2>



<p>On top of trading and borrowing fees, Futureswap has its own token called Futureswap Tokens (FST) which creates incentives that reward the users that contribute the most to the system. </p>



<h3>Futureswap Tokens (FST)</h3>



<p>Futureswap Tokens (FST) are non-transferable tokens given out weekly to traders, liquidity providers, and referrers and are used to govern Futureswap as well as incentivize user participation. </p>



<p><strong>FST tokens are distributed weekly according to your portion of the total trade volume, liquidity provided, and/or referrals. </strong>Essentially, the more you use Futureswap, the more FST you earn over time.</p>



<h3>Trading Fee Discounts</h3>



<p>Traders earn FST based on their total weekly trades proportional to the total trade volume for that week. The higher your % of total trading volume, the higher your weekly FST reward.</p>



<p>Traders who hold FST also receive discounts on their trading fees. These discounts are calculated on a logarithmic curve and can reduce trading fees by up to 30%. The cool part is that you aren&#8217;t required to burn the tokens to receive the discount.</p>



<h3>Earn FST with Referrals</h3>



<p>Futureswap has built-in referral rewards for users who drive trading volume to the platform. Referrer FST earnings are based on closed trade volume of users you refer in proportion to total closed trade volume of users from other referrers. </p>



<p>Anyone can create a referral link for their Ethereum address and start earning fees by simply adding to the Futureswap links ?src=[YOU ADDRESS HERE] parameter.  </p>



<p>For example<a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0x1E042E6a150961E3aC07b7eF0643776A5b6a73ac">,</a> here&#8217;s what our referral link looks like <a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0">https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0</a>. <br><em>We appreciate any use of our referral link as it helps support DeFi Pulse.</em></p>



<h3>Governance proposals</h3>



<p>Futureswap is designed to be fully decentralized and community-run as soon as possible. The distribution of FST rewards the most active users for participating. These FST holders then create and vote on new proposals like adding new trading pairs and changing system parameters. Stakeholders must burn FST to create new proposals.</p>



<h3>Reflections on Futureswap&#8217;s design</h3>



<p>As I dug into Futureswap to write this post, I grew to appreciate its design. From the DFR to the distribution of FST, the Futureswap team has paid a particular attention to detail. </p>



<p>For example, Futureswap trading pairs use Chainlink for their price feed oracles. The system also has built-in protections against front running attacks. New position creation timestamps are checked relative to the Chainlink price update. If the new position is opened within a 3 minute window before the price update, the system bumps the user up to the next price on trade close. </p>



<h2>The early bird gets the worm</h2>



<p>The truth is that being an early adopter comes with its advantages. Futureswap Tokens will be distributed to the platform&#8217;s most active users. Futureswap&#8217;s design utilizes FST to incentivize users to participate when activity is low. </p>



<p>Early Futureswap adopters are more likely to have larger contributions proportional to the system total thus earning more FST. So it stands to reason that you&#8217;ll earn more FST by participating sooner rather than later after the community grows even larger and more active.</p>



<h4><strong><a href="https://exchange.futureswap.com/?src=0xDA5167FfCa51e72703DCC2c0F2fEF1bB3A790fa0">Futureswap</a> is set to launch at Monday afternoon PST (April 20, 2020) so there&#8217;s never been a better time to get involved.</strong></h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A decentralized exchange, or DEX for short, is like a stock exchange run by a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Although both allow you to trade assets, a decentralized exchange trades cryptocurrency only and so does not require a centralized authority to operate. Instead, a decentralized exchange uses a smart contract to enforce the rules, execute trades, and securely handle funds when necessary.</p>
<h4>In order to examine the differences, let&#8217;s break down what a centralized exchange looks like in traditional finance.</h4>
<p>Exchanges are where you buy and sell things. More specifically, financial exchanges are where you trade financial assets and commodities. In traditional finance, these assets are held in custody by a central exchange who takes orders from buyers and sellers for commodities, stock, securities, currencies, and more.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7391 size-medium" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-300x200.jpg" alt="decentralized exchnage" width="300" height="200" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/07/m-b-m-ZzOa5G8hSPI-unsplash-1568x1045.jpg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>To execute a trade, you submit an order to the exchange who then either puts it onto their orderbooks to be filled later or fills the order with an existing order on the books. When you make an order which gets put in the orderbook, it&#8217;s called a maker order. And when your trade order is filled by taking an existing one off the books, your order is considered a taker order.</p>
<h4>DEXes are exchanges built using smart contracts</h4>
<p>Decentralized exchanges are smart contracts written to perform a similar process as the one described above. They allow users to trade cryptocurrencies like ETH for other coins or tokens simply by interacting with their contracts from their wallet.</p>
<p>When you submit trade orders to a DEX, you&#8217;re submitting a transaction to their smart contract on the blockchain. Some DEXes have orderbooks with maker and taker orders. Whereas, other DEXes have pools or reserves of currencies ready to swaps or trades.</p>
<h4>Using a decentralized exchange reduces your risk of hack or theft</h4>
<p>There&#8217;s a risk to putting your money in someone else&#8217;s hands. This is especially true when it comes to cryptocurrency. Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges hold millions of dollars of their customers&#8217; funds and are prime targets for hackers and thieves.</p>
<p>Decentralized exchanges reduce this risk by either letting you keep your funds in your wallet until the order is filled. Or rather, the funds are held in a smart contract secured by the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Try it our yourself! It&#8217;s easy; just use <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> to find the best prices from 10 different DEXes in one click. And then, just punch in your desire trading pair and amount, hit Buy Now, and in seconds you&#8217;ll have made your first trade on a DEX.</p>
