<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Another week, another intriguing chat to share with you all. For this week&#8217;s Founder Fireside Chat, we spoke with Ross Middleton, Co-Founder of <a href="https://defipulse.com/deversifi">DeversiFi</a>, about the leap forward in technology that rollups represent for our industry.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">DeversiFI is a layer-2 exchange built on Ethereum. When we set out 2 years ago, we wanted to give people all the features and benefits that they were used to from trading on a large centralised exchange, but without giving up control of their funds. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We launched on the StarkWare validium technology 10 months ago to launch the first scalable &amp; private DEX that offers incredible aggregated liquidity for major pairs. Trading &amp; Swapping on DeversiFi is private &#8211; privacy and aggregated liquidity are two of the main differentiators vs other order book DEXs.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I think all three are important aspects. For those who haven&#8217;t encountered DeversiFI before, DeversiFi is a layer-2 exchanges that uses zk rollup/validium technology to achieve scalability without sacrificing security or decentralisation. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We examined a number of different scaling solutions (and built one or two ourselves) before landing on zk rollup technology as rollups really do solve the scalability trilemma.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Building a product that people find useful and can actively be a real part of is key in building a long lasting community. <strong>If you give people a unique tool that solves one of their daily pain points then they are only too happy to provide feedback and put their time into making your project even better.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I am biased here but Layer-2 really is the future. All of these &#8216;Ethereum killer&#8217; layer-1 chains are having their moment in the sun because fees on Ethereum are so high at the moment. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We have operating Layer-2 exchanges on Ethereum that allow people to trade &amp; swap without paying any gas at all. <strong>Within 12 months we will also start to see Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible rollups, bridges and CEX on/off-boarding. There may never be a reason for anyone to every touch Layer-1 Ethereum ever again, let alone another blockchain.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">So many! We launched at the bottom of the bear market in 2020, before DEXs and DeFi was really a thing. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">We had an existing DEX that settled every trade on-chain, but it was taking up a lot of time to support and interfered with our ability to raise financing as people thought it was our main product. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In hindsight, we should have stopped supporting our old product and focused entirely on the new one. There are so many other lessons that we have learned as a team but we don&#8217;t have time to go into more than one of two!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">I like the &#8216;waiting for Eth 2.0 to launch meme&#8217; the most because <strong>we actually don&#8217;t need Eth 2.0 to fully launch now that we have a whole ecosystem of rollups that is springing up.</strong> I see rollups as a way to scale Ethereum for the long run, not just whilst we are waiting for execution sharding.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Chaz Schmidt:</strong> <em>Hello and welcome @everyone ! Thank you for joining us today for an AMA with Simone Rigolon, Founder of Impermax.</em></p>



<p><em>Simone will be answering questions we&#8217;ve collected from you, the community, throughout the week. Special thanks to everyone who submitted questions for today&#8217;s AMA.</em></p>



<p><em>Thanks for joining us Simone.</em> <strong>How are you today?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone Rigolon</strong>: Hi Chaz and DeFi Pulse community! It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m very good, and you?</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I&#8217;m doing quite well. Thanks for asking.<br><br>To start things off, can you share a little about Impermax for the audience? </em><strong>What is Impermax?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Impermax is a decentralized lending protocol designed around LP tokens.</p>



<p>It allows borrowers to use LP tokens as collateral to take loans. This enables them to enter in leveraged positions on their LP tokens.</p>



<p>On the other hand lenders are able to &#8220;indirectly provide liquidity&#8221; to Automated Market Makers by supplying their tokens to the borrowers. Lenders are able indirectly earn from AMMs trading fees without any exposure to impermanent loss.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Very cool. You touched on a point that piqued the community&#8217;s interest earlier this week on Twitter. </em><strong>Can you explain lndirect Liquidity Providing for those unfamiliar with the concept?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone:<em> </em></strong>Let&#8217;s start from normal liquidity providing which means supplying tokens to an AMM. This can be a very profitable way to invest capital, but at the same time there is the risk of impermanent loss and there are some complexity that are going to get worse with time. Basicallly it is not ideal for the average user.</p>



<p>Indirect liquidity providing means that you can lend your tokens to liquidity providers. They will borrow them and use them to provide liquidity to AMMs and earn trading fees. In return you will get a percentage of the trading fees they earn. This is ideal for the average user because it can be a &#8220;set and forget thing&#8221;, there is no exposure to IL and it requires only a single token.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong><em> Ahh. So for example with for the USDC/ETH LP token pool you could provide USDC and earn trading fees without exposure to impermanent loss?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Exactly <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Browsing through Impermax ahead of the AMA I noticed that LP token lending pools are isolated. </em><strong>What does this mean for Impermax users and what led to the decision to isolate the lending pools?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>There are many reasons that lead to this decision but the main one is that we wanted to build a protocol that was as permissionless as possible. Keeping all lending pools separated means that anyone can create a new one because even a malicious pool wouldn&#8217;t be able to affect negatively all the other existing pools.</p>



<p>The main advantages of this choice are scalability, security and minimized governance.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>That makes sense. Isolating the pools also isolates risk, mitigating any chance of systematic failure from one bad pair.</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Exactly, it&#8217;s an architecture very similar to the one used by Uniswap for pairs.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>So Uniswap pairs are supported by Impermax today and the community wants to know: </em><strong>What AMM LP tokens do you plan to support in the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>The plan is to add support for more AMMs like Uniswap V3, SushiSwap, PancekeSwap and others. Ideally we would want to support as many LP tokens as possible. Luckily our choice of keeping all lending pairs isolated allow us to scale as much as we want since supporting a new LP tokens doesn&#8217;t have any drawback on the existing ones.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I&#8217;m glad you brought up Uniswap V3 because I saw that on your <a href="https://impermax.medium.com/impermax-road-map-e320fdb4652d">roadmap</a> the other day and wondered how that will work with V3&#8217;s new price curve NFT setup. </em><strong>Can you shed any light on that at this time? </strong><em>We will accept soon <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> if necessary</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> I can&#8217;t give too many details on how exactly it will work because we&#8217;re still researching LP NFTs and the way they can be used as collateral. Some complicated math involved, so it&#8217;s hard to talk about that in an AMA. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Personally I&#8217;m very excited about supporting LP NFTs on Impermax because Uniswap V3 is very capital efficient by itself, and with NFTs enabled to be used as collateral that&#8217;s going to improve even more!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>No worries! The audience can stay tuned for that one. We only have a few minutes left anyways.</em></p>



<p><em>Since we&#8217;re on the topic of the roadmap,</em> <strong>what’s coming up on the roadmap that you’re excited about?</strong><br><br><em>Or even a recent release since you mentioned LP NFTs.</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Many things like new features for the existing app, support for Uniswap V3 support for layer 2 and other networks.</p>



<p>I bet users are going to be very happy once Impermax releases on lower fees networks, but personally the thing I&#8217;m most excited about is Uniswap V3 support, for the reasons I&#8217;ve just talked about. Capital efficiency is key for AMMs in the long term and both UniswapV3 and Impermax are solutions to improve it.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>When you put it like that, it&#8217;s easier to see why on your website, you describe Impermax as “The missing piece to the Automated Market Makers&#8217; puzzle”</em></p>



<p><em>In your own words, </em><strong>how does Impermax complement AMMs and where do you see Impermax fitting into the puzzle?</strong><br><br><em>We&#8217;ve reached 30 minutes. Do you have time to answer this and maybe one other question?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Wow time runs fast. Yes, I have have time.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I know right? Awesome I wanted to touch on one other aspect of Impermax that our community was asking about.<br><br>Impermax introduced a liquidity mining program which rewards users with IMX tokens for borrowing on Impermax.</em> <strong>What was the motivation behind incentivizing borrowing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong> The main reason is to incentivize the protocol usage and attract more liquidity. Impermax needs a lot of liquidity in order for the incentives to really work as they should. Farming is always a good way to bootstrap a new protocol.</p>



<p>There are a few reasons why we incentivized only borrowing and not lending. The main one is because lenders are still indirectly rewarded since the borrowing demand is very high. Not giving the reward to lenders means that they don&#8217;t have to worry about claiming it and instead they are rewarded with an higher supply APR that will compound over time.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Interesting. In other words, borrowers pursuing more liquidity mining rewards earn more trading fees for lenders.<br><br>I think that&#8217;s about all the time we have for today. Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to say?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Not really, I just want to thank you and DeFi Pulse for organizing this event. It was a pleasure to answer these questions.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>You&#8217;re welcome as always. Thank you for coming! I learned a thing or two and I&#8217;m sure the audience found it helpful.</em></p>



<p><em>And thank you all for coming to today&#8217;s AMA!</em></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">To kick off our Founder Fireside Chat series, we speak with <a href="https://twitter.com/ericinjective">Eric Chen</a>, Co-founder of <a href="https://injectiveprotocol.com/">Injective Protocol</a>, who is working to bring unparalleled access to new decentralized derivatives markets with restrictions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Injective Protocol is the first fully decentralized exchange protocol that unlocks the full potential of decentralized derivatives and borderless DeFi. Injective Protocol enables fully decentralized trading without any restrictions, allowing individuals to trade on any derivative market of their choosing. A few unique features set us apart from the rest. We are devoid of any and all gas fees, which means no one has to pay the ridiculously high gas fees that currently plague the Ethereum ecosystem. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In addition, we enable a higher level of interoperability given our integration with the Cosmos network. We are also an orderbook model exchange with instant finality, so traders are able to trade more freely without having to worry about slippage and other issues on DEXs today. Our scaling infrastructure also allows us to scale Ethereum-based transactions with composability with the greater DeFi ecosystem.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I would have to go with decentralization. <strong>If we sacrifice decentralization, we&#8217;re no better than the legacy CeFi infrastructure.</strong> As a result, I think that this is the most important aspect that sets apart blockchain-based systems from other platforms.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">I believe decentralized derivatives hold tremendous promise. In traditional finance, <strong>this sector encompasses literally quadrillions of dollars</strong>. If DeFi can capture even 1% of this market, it would tremendously help accelerate the adoption of crypto-based networks as a whole.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">Due to the technical nature of our team and origin, we started off Injective with an overly complicated structure that proved to be unsustainable in the long run due to its engineering challenges. <strong>What we&#8217;ve learned is that we should take Occam&#8217;s razor approach when it comes to product focus and development.</strong> This way we can provide a clear avenue and value proposition for new traders to access our ecosystem. This is why we built a user-friendly frontend that helps to abstract away the decentralized infrastructure, leading to an exchange that can be adopted globally.</p>

<p><strong><em>Off the heels of Aave Protocol storming DeFi Pulse&#8217;s rankings, Stani Kulechov founder and CEO of Aave joins us today</em></strong>.</p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I first got into crypto because of the Ethereum community back when I was in college. I was studying Law, but I my true passion has always been finance. When you look at the traditional financial system, there are many inefficiencies. I wanted to build an ecosystem where people have control over their money, and finance is transparent and open.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>We released Aave Protocol nearly a month ago, and already we have over 5 million USD liquidity locked in our protocol. Aave provides a money lending market similar to Compound, but instead of just focusing on the total locked amount of assets, Aave re-uses locked assets within the Ethereum ecosystem. We wanted to come up with innovative tools that utilize the assets in different ways, and that’s how we came up with flash loans. Flash loans are a tool for developers to borrow liquidity from the protocol without needing to put up any collateral, provided that the liquidity is returned to the protocol within one transaction (a single block). You can use flash loans to do some fancy arbitraging, refinancing, and much more. The use-cases people come up with are super cool, because you can really apply them in creative ways. The end goal for flash loans is to help developers build financial products without needing capital, enabling more people to build and lowering the barrier to entry.</p>



<p>Another exciting feature is our Aave interest-bearing tokens called “aTokens”. When someone deposits an asset in Aave Protocol, a smart contract mints an equivalent amount of aTokens, which are pegged 1:1 to the underlying asset and are sent to the lender. For example, if you deposit 200 Dai, you will get 200 aDai in your wallet. The underlying asset, in this case the 200 Dai, is loaned out to borrowers while the aDai accrue interest in real time directly in your wallet. You can redirect this interest at any time to any Ethereum address, putting you in control over your earnings.</p>



<p>Aave Protocol also lets users switch between stable and variable rates when borrowing, so that the interest-rate is always on your side. Stable rates give the user more certainty than variable rates, which can fluctuate a lot. You can always switch—if you have a variable rate and the rate starts going up, you can switch to the stable rate, for example.</p>



<p>We knew we needed to offer new features with Aave Protocol. You can’t just do the same thing as everyone else—in order to get people into DeFi you need to come up with new tools that can really benefit users.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>Everyone! We want to bring DeFi into the mainstream, but we understand that there are some hurdles to this, such as education, since people can find anything “blockchain” intimidating and people do not understand the value of DeFi yet. Right now, our main users are devs, especially since some tools like flashloans are designed specifically for people with some technical knowledge. However, anyone can use Aave protocol to earn interest on their crypto or borrow assets.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>We are very excited to hand over the governance to the community of LEND holders. Currently, Aave is keeping the governance in case there are any issues with the protocol, but it has been built and will be released to the public very soon. LEND holders will have voting power and be able to make important decisions regarding the governance of the protocol.</p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>We want to bring DeFi into the mainstream conscience by building tools that people can really use, and want to use, to control their money. Money should never just sleep in a traditional bank account when you can put it in DeFi and earn some interest, borrow, etc. People want to have control over their finances and see their money working for them 24/7. They also value transparency and openness, which you don’t necessarily get in the old-school financial system.</p>



<h3>What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>I think people should be looking at uncollateralized loan options, like Aave protocol’s flash loans. DeFi usually relies on overcollateralized loans, but this requires borrowers to put up tons of collateral, which not everybody has. Uncollateralized loans make it easier for people to borrow and doesn’t require lots of capital, making it more accessible.</p>
