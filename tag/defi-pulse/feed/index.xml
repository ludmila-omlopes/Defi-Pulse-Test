										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This past year has been an incredible time of maturation and expansion for decentralized finance. Familiar protocols have seen increased adoption, cementing the foundation on which the whirlwind of new projects have been built. Our community has multiplied in numbers. Countless newcomers are venturing down the DeFi rabbit hole where it is easy to get lost in the numerous technological and economic terms and concepts you must learn. The whole experience can be ultimately overwhelming because not only is DeFi expanding wider, it is also getting deeper.<br><br>As DeFi grows larger with more complex and moving parts, it’s important that we have the tools necessary to safely sustain said growth. Each new user, token, feature, project, or protocol adds a variable that users need to take into account when weighing the risks of the protocols that they use. It’s difficult to say the least for users, new and old, to properly assess and compare economic risk across protocols. DeFi Pulse has long been an advocate for user safety and educating users about risk because informed users make informed decisions which results in a healthier ecosystem. And so, we’ve partnered with financial simulation experts at Gauntlet to provide a simpler way to inform users of risk: DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade.</p>



<h2><strong>DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade, as the name implies, is a 1 to 100 grade that allows users to more easily quantify and compare the economic risks of using on-chain protocols. Grades are created by running simulations utilizing data from centralized and decentralized exchanges combined with on-chain user data to estimate market risks. For a more in-depth explanation of the simulation model, we recommend you read this <a href="https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/understanding-risk-in-defi-f64574593979">blog post from Gauntlet</a>.</p>



<p>At launch, safety grades are primarily focused on the risk of insolvency for decentralized protocols or, in other words, the risk to the depositor.  Lending protocols are a perfect starting point because they are one of the most popular DeFi applications and have many compounding variables. Gauntlet’s simulations assess four key factors: user behavior, collateral volatility, relative collateral liquidity, protocol parameters. All of these risk factors combined are practically impossible for the average user to evaluate. Our position in the community allows us to take Gauntlet’s sophisticated models and communicate them in a digestible format for a wide audience. The net result of which we hope is a safer DeFi ecosystem full of users mindful of risk.</p>



<p><strong>Safety grades are now available for </strong><a href="https://defipulse.com/aave"><strong>Aave</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://defipulse.com/compound"><strong>Compound</strong></a><strong> on DeFi Pulse.</strong> In this initial alpha, these grades are formed by analyzing the historical liquidity and volatility data to find the &#8216;riskiest collateral&#8217;. Then, the risk of the system for users borrowing stablecoins against this collateral is estimated and normalized to create the 1 to 100 grade you see on DeFi Pulse. The higher the grade, the higher the economic safety the protocol.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Imagine you&#8217;re trying out a new DeFi project. Everything is going smoothly; the instructions on screen guide you, making you feel confident in your actions. That is until you complete your transaction and then your tokens don&#8217;t arrive. You start to get that sinking feeling in your stomach as you realize you&#8217;ve received tokens the wrong tokens&#8230;</p>



<p>Looking at your transaction confirmation you realize you received a token with the same name and ticker symbol as the one you thought you selected. In fact, upon reviewing the token selection menu you realize there are lots of inaccurate and confusing tokens listed. It&#8217;s a simple mistake but costly mistake anyone could make that leaves a sour taste in your mouth about the whole experience.</p>



<h4>So what happened?</h4>



<p>On Ethereum, anyone can create a token with any name or ticker symbol. It&#8217;s not like registering a username on a website; there&#8217;s no native mechanism preventing a new token from having the same name, symbol, or even icon as an existing token. Whether intentionally or not, duplicate or misleading tokens are created all the time making mistakes like the one described above more and more likely to occur for even the most experienced users.</p>



<p>Not to mention, DeFi grows so quickly that it&#8217;s practically impossible to keep up with the countless new tokens being produced by projects. DAI alone has over 30 variations. This situation isn&#8217;t slowing down anytime soon and a lot of collective time is being spent in our community right now playing detective in order to determine if a token is the right token.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/token-list-thumb-1-wo-padding.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8247" width="638" height="638"/></a></figure></div>



<h2>Meet The Token List</h2>



<p>The Token List provides an accurate list of authentic tokens submitted and curated by the community. Its purpose is to create a standard list of tokens that everyone can rely on. <strong>Anyone can apply to have a token added to The Token List as long as it isn’t likely to be confused with previously listed or well-known tokens. And, it&#8217;s free for anyone to integrate The Token List into their project.</strong></p>



<p>A reliable well-vetted token list serves as a source of truth for the community helping ensure users are never confused by misleading tokens or outright scams. The idea is that when you see a platform is using The Token List, you can be confident that the tokens available are the real deal.</p>



<h3>Implementation is fast, easy and forever free</h3>



<p>Integrating The Token List into your project is simple and worry-free with little to no maintenance. <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a> lets your team work smarter, not harder. No more wasting man hours on listing new tokens on top of maintaining the ever-growing list of existing tokens. And best of all, <strong>it&#8217;s forever free to use</strong> &#8211; no upfront cost or ongoing fees.</p>



<p>The Token List provides all the relevant information for each authentic token in JSON format: </p>



<ul><li>token name</li><li>contract address </li><li>ticker symbol </li><li>decimals</li><li>icon image</li><li>token standard (ERC20, ERC223, etc)</li><li>and flags describing token qualities such as: is it used in governance, is it a social token, etc.</li></ul>



<p>We handle the listing and maintenance for you so you can get back to building what matters.</p>



<h4>Got a token? Apply to The Token List in a snap.</h4>



<p>As previously mentioned, anyone can submit an application to list any authentic token to The Token List. Simply, visit <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a>, click the &#8216;Add a Token now!&#8217; button (powered by Unlock Protocol). It costs a flat fee of 0.05 ETH to apply. And then, follow the prompts to fill out the simple form with the required token details. </p>



<p>We review all applications for authenticity and to ensure that they are unique enough to not confuse the average user. We want to help improve user experience, not act as gatekeepers, so we&#8217;ll err on the side of inclusion where possible (but for the safety of the community we do reserve the right to reject outright scams or tokens intending to mislead, etc).</p>



<h3>Adaptive token selection</h3>



<p>Opening up the token listing process benefits all involved by making UX/UIs become more responsive and inclusive. Instead of acting as a potential gatekeepers, DeFi projects now become advocates of collaboration and empower their community to take ownership of the token listing process. Additionally, the community lends their watchful eyes to help maintain the accuracy and authenticity of existing token listings (because we know how fast some things change in DeFi).</p>



<h3>Collaboration and composability</h3>



<p>The ability to connect and combine existing smart contracts to create something new is a defining aspect of DeFi. We&#8217;re an industry built on collaboration which increases the pace of innovation. Projects and users alike benefit from keeping this shared list of tokens up-to-date with the latest listings and changes to existing tokens, potentially serving as a catalyst for even more composability between DeFi projects. Naturally, it&#8217;s easier to work together when you&#8217;re all on the same page. For example: when one project submits their newest token, it&#8217;s automatically added to all projects using The Token List.</p>



<h2>Take advantage of The Token List today</h2>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re hacking together an idea, tired of maintaining your current token listings, or want to make your token known to the world, <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a> is a simple but effective solution to meet your needs.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re really excited for this release and the potential impact an open, accessible standard token list could have on DeFi. Standards can improve quality of life and safety for users and make developers&#8217; work easier and more efficient. We&#8217;re also interested to see how this list will grow with community input. We&#8217;re 100% open to new ideas like new descriptive flags. So please let us know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/defipulse">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/Gx4TCTk">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/defipulse">Telegram</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DeFi doesn&#8217;t just stand for decentralized finance; DeFi is a community of users, developers, investors, traders, researchers, writers, and so much more. Our collective endeavors are etched into the blockchain; our stories and shared history can be found in our data.</p>



<p>Ask anyone who&#8217;s familiar with DeFi and they&#8217;ll tell you that it&#8217;s been exhilarating to be a part of. Week by week, we&#8217;ve crossed milestones, set new records, and broken new ground. We set goals and then build towards them until they are fulfilled. Our community takes data from the blockchain and translates it into meaningful events that represent our community&#8217;s story and what it values.</p>



<p>At Concourse Open, we&#8217;ve witnessed this firsthand with our Total Value Locked metric. When we built DeFi Pulse a little over a year ago, we could have never imagined how well it would be received by the community. So many stories have been told with our data and illustrated with our charts. </p>

</div><figcaption><em>Graphic made using data from DeFi Pulse Data</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>We want everyone to have access to the data they need. <a href="https://data.defipulse.com/">DeFi Pulse Data</a> combines its popular DeFi metrics with data from Concourse Open&#8217;s other popular services&#8217; APIs like ETHGasStation and Rekto which thousands of users, websites, and applications rely upon everyday to understand the decentralized ecosystem. Most notably, Ethereum gas price data provided by ETHGasStation’s API has become essential for decentralized application (DApp) developers. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://data.defipulse.com/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8212" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-1536x864.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-1568x882.png 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>We understand how valuable accurate data can be when it comes to making informed decisions or effectively accomplishing a task. That&#8217;s why anyone can try DeFi Pulse Data and access all of its comprehensive data sets by simply <a href="https://data.defipulse.com/">signing up for a free account</a>. Because, we know the right data in the right hands can have a big impact on our community. </p>



<h3>How we utilize data determines our past, present, and future.</h3>



<p>The way we frame and interpret data points can tell a story, justify a design choice, confirm a hypothesize, and much much more. And when you examine our community, it couldn&#8217;t be clearer that our data represents our past actions but what we create  with that data determines our future.</p>



<p>We share in the triumph of moments like when the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi broke $1 Billion. We cheer together however our eyes are still looking toward the future.</p>

<p>We see that 1 BILLION and want to build bigger and better things to get to that next billion. The data taps into something deeply rooted in our brains and inspires us to keep moving forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It&#8217;s been a wild ride watching decentralized finance grow alongside the DeFi Pulse community. From every celebratory tweet about climbing up a rank on our leaderboard to the palpable buzz around new listings, we&#8217;ve been blown away with how the community has adopted our metrics and relied on us as a resource for DeFi. We&#8217;ve always prided ourselves on the quality data and transparency we could help bring to DeFi.</p>



<h3>DeFi is growing fast like really, <em>really</em> fast</h3>



<p>The thing with DeFi is that it evolves like an organism. Say one team makes a cool new feature for their project. Then, another project likes that new feature and integrates it into their DApp. Soon enough, it has become a standard for the industry. This happens faster and faster has the money legos begin to stack up, combine, and innovate quicker. As time goes on and with each and every update, addition, and improvement, decentralized finance grows exponentially. And it becomes exponentially harder to track. </p>



<p>We&#8217;ve come across this phenomenon while building and maintaining DeFi Pulse&#8217;s metrics. Staying on top of the entire DeFi space is something we knew we couldn&#8217;t always do alone. Allowing projects to contribute towards tracking their own metrics seemed like the most practical first step to ensuring we always provide users with the most reliable and accurate data as the space continues to grow. To keep up with this decentralized industry, many projects listed on DeFi Pulse now contribute code to their unique adapter to track their DeFi metrics. </p>

<p>Recent events have illustrated first-hand how interconnected DeFi as an industry is and the importance of informing users on the risks involved with DeFi. As many people&#8217;s starting point for discovering decentralized finance, DeFi Pulse understands its responsibility to the community, especially new users. It occurred to us once again that due to the sheer rate of DeFi&#8217;s growth, the only way to take on systematic risks in decentralized finance is by working together with the community to form standards for monitoring and assessing user risks. So in order to avoid our becoming gatekeepers of DeFi, we&#8217;re taking steps to give the keys back to the kingdom.</p>



<h3>The truth is DeFi has grown beyond the scope of one set of eyes</h3>



<p>Introducing the DeFi Pulse Registry, a new directory of DeFi projects committed to transparency about user risk. With over 1 in 40 ETH locked in DeFi (and growing), this is a vital time to develop community standards around risk.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="588" height="304" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Selection_999083.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8084" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Selection_999083.png 588w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Selection_999083-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px" /></figure></div>



<p>The goal is to work with the community to create a registry of DeFi projects and the potential risks users may face while using them. DeFi Pulse Registry  will help DeFi users make better decisions by making it easy to find reliable info regarding projects&#8217; risks. </p>



<p><strong>The DeFi Pulse Registry plans to track three major categories of DeFi user risks:</strong><br><strong>Centralization Risk</strong> &#8211; <em>What are the risks to users associated with admin privileges?</em><br><strong>Economic Risk</strong> &#8211; <em>How has the project addressed the economic risks of using this protocol?</em><br><strong>Security Risk</strong> &#8211; <em>How has the project addressed the security risks of using this protocol</em>?<br>Of course we&#8217;re interested in receiving feedback from the community about what risk metrics should be tracked. And in time, we will look to decentralize the management of this registry as part of a broader effort to decentralize DeFi Pulse. </p>



<p>Most new users know the general risks of crypto and DeFi, but things change so fast, and users struggle to get a true sense of each protocol&#8217;s specific risks. Still, they trust us by locking lots of real value in our protocols and apps. Then when something goes wrong, many feel blindsided or betrayed and leave the space for good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can build stronger relationships with users by trusting them with complete, current info about the risks they face. A DeFi protocol user with full knowledge of all risks involved is more likely to return after a loss than a user who was simply cautioned to do her own research and avoid risking too much money. DeFi Pulse Registry aims to build trust with users through openness about risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4>Please support us today to create a safer DeFi for tomorrow</h4>



<p>As ironic as it sounds, we hope that everyone in the industry, from users to project developers, sees the value in building trust among DeFi users for trustless systems. So please, if you&#8217;re interested in contributing, donate to the <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/552/defi-pulse-registry?tab=description">DeFi Pulse Registry Gitcoin Grant</a> and share this message with members of our community.</p>

<p>DeFi Pulse is part of Concourse Open Community (along with projects like DEX.AG and ETH Gas Station). We&#8217;re a small, distributed team, and we&#8217;ve been fully self-funded since our start in 2017. We&#8217;re only interested in outside funding that doesn&#8217;t require compromising our core values.&nbsp;</p>
