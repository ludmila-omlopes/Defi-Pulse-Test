										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the course of 2020, more than 140,000 BTC entered the DeFi ecosystem. With so many different alternatives for Bitcoin tokens, it only makes sense to break it out into its own page to provide more detailed metrics. We&#8217;re excited to introduce a new page highlighting the use of Bitcoin in the DeFi ecosystem. <a href="http://defipulse.com/btc">Bitcoin at Work</a> measures the total amount of BTC being utilized within decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="http://defipulse.com/btc"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-1024x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8793" width="512" height="512" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-150x150.png 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-768x768.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>We worked with 10 different teams from all across our industry to bring you a wide variety of BTC token metrics. <strong>The following BTC tokens will be included at launch:&nbsp;WBTC, RENBTC, HBTC, sBTC, tBTC, imBTC, oBTC, acBTC, pBTC, and BTC++.</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-1024x512.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8785" width="768" height="384" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-1024x512.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-300x150.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-768x384.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<p>As you might have noticed, WBTC has been moved to this new page and its TVL is no longer included in the TVL metrics found on our homepage. WBTC was originally added to the leaderboard at a time when it was practically the only tokenized BTC utilized in DeFi, but given the current landscape we now think it is a better fit for the Bitcoin at Work leaderboard.</p>



<p>We know that not every BTC token is quite the same. Each one has its own method of minting and redeeming and varying degrees of centralization ranging from custodial to fully decentralized.<strong> </strong><br><strong>We broke down each BTC token into four types to better distinguish their different qualities:<br></strong><br><strong>Decentralized</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held within a fully decentralized protocol<br><br><strong>Custodial</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held in custody by a third party<br><br><strong>Synthetic</strong> &#8211; a token which follows the price of Bitcoin but is not directly backed by BTC<br><br><strong>Hybrid</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held within an open protocol transitioning towards decentralization</p>



<p>Aside from recognizing the hard work and growth of this sector, we hope the metrics and information included in this new page will help DeFi users discover new possibilities and make more informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Special thanks to all the teams for working with us! Be sure to check out the new page and explore the <a href="http://defipulse.com/btc">Bitcoin at Work</a> metrics for yourself. And if you’re interested in joining the DeFi Pulse Leaderboard, please check out this <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-to-join-the-defi-pulse-leaderboard/">step-by-step guide.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you follow DeFi, you’ve probably noticed that the concept of yield farming is everywhere lately. From some of the most original memes in the Ethereum ecosystem to traditional news outlets like Forbes, crop rotation to maximize yield across protocols has become one of the defining activities on DeFi in 2020.</p>



<h3><strong>So, what is Yield Farming?</strong></h3>



<p>Yield farming is the act of leveraging different DeFi protocols and products to earn a yield or a return on their assets, in some cases obtaining profits well over 100% APY through a combination of lending interest and token incentives. </p>



<p>The recent yield farming frenzy made total value Locked (TVL) on DeFi skyrocket to new all-time highs, zooming far past $2B. Yield farming has had a substantial impact on protocols like Compound, Balancer, Curve, MCDEX, and Uniswap V2 just to name a few as DeFi users aim to cash in on the trend. This frenzy has brought some important questions to light. Should short term speculative usage of the Ethereum network be considered an indicator of long term adoption? Is this frenzy only a momentary activity that will lose traction once yields go down? Ultimately, is this the beginning of a new growth cycle for Ethereum?</p>



<h3><strong>How Did The Yield Farming Frenzy begin?</strong></h3>



<p>The Yield Farming frenzy started when Compound began the live distribution of COMP, its governance token, on June 14th. Compound reached more than $600M total value locked, and overtook MakerDAO for the first time ever on DeFi Pulse’s leaderboard, making it the #1 protocol in DeFi by this measure in a matter of days. However, COMP appears to have only been the beginning with Balancer having launched their protocol rewards incentive program in May started their live distribution a few days after Compound. Balancer experienced similar exponential growth, adding more than $70M TVL.</p>



<p>Although the frenzy started with COMP, yield farming has been known and practiced in DeFi for some time now. Synthetix, for example, had introduced the concept of protocol token rewards in exchange for liquidity provision to the sETH/ETH pool on Uniswap V1 in July 2019.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today marks the end of an era. Right as yield farming is taking off we just finalised a poll on SCCP-29 <a href="https://t.co/bXU07AjQsd">https://t.co/bXU07AjQsd</a>. This was the original yield farming pool for sETH:ETH on Uniswap V1. So as it winds down, let&#39;s take a little trip down memory lane.</p>&mdash; kain.eth (@kaiynne) <a href="https://twitter.com/kaiynne/status/1276417760222797825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Things really started taking off a few hours after COMP began being distributed and users started heavily investing in the USDT market on Compound, the one paying the highest amount of COMP rewards. COMP is distributed on a 50%-50% basis between suppliers and borrowers of a given market, and total rewards are allocated in a proportional way to each market’s yield returns. One of the many strategies that were applied was taking out USDT loans with DAI as collateral and investing them in the corresponding market on Compound. Next, BAT became the most profitable market for COMP farming. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just went short on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$USDT</a> using <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DAI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$DAI</a> as collateral on <a href="https://t.co/cnckUC54V0">https://t.co/cnckUC54V0</a> using maximum <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24COMP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$COMP</a> mining recipe.<br><br>Looks like I&#39;m earning way more than I&#39;m paying interest with the current <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24COMP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$COMP</a> price hovering around ~$60.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/YOLO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#YOLO</a> <a href="https://t.co/03YGZm0Jui">pic.twitter.com/03YGZm0Jui</a></p>&mdash; Samyak Jain (@smykjain) <a href="https://twitter.com/smykjain/status/1272634332599824390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Compound’s team proposed to update the system’s liquidity incentive one week after COMP distribution went live on June 27th. The proposal looked to discourage an inorganic demand for BAT and other assets since users were concentrating extreme liquidation risks into these markets. The new liquidity incentive proposal was executed on July 2nd. Currently, COMP is distributed proportionally across the markets that borrow more dollars, and not dollars of interest paid. Rewards continue to be distributed on a 50%-50% basis between suppliers and borrowers of a given market. You can read more about <a href="https://compound.comradery.io/post/1762">Compound’s proposal to update the system’s liquidity incentives here.<br><br></a>The liquidity incentive effectively discouraged farmers from leveraging markets such as BAT. And now, yield farmers have ballooned the Compound DAI markets to levels higher than the total DAI in existence.  You can check out <a href="https://compound.finance/markets">the current Compound markets here</a> and <a href="https://compound.finance/governance/comp">COMP distribution here</a>.</p>



<p>Balancer began its live distribution of BAL on June 23rd, which caused a spike of more than $50M in TVL in a few days. You likely recall our previous DeFi Pulse Drop with <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/balancer-start-liquidity-mining-and-earn-bal-tokens-today/">Balancer Labs announcing their liquidity incentive program, which allows users to earn BAL on top of pool swap fees</a>. Seventy-five million BAL tokens (75% of fully diluted supply) will be distributed among liquidity providers on a 145K weekly basis.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Is this the beginning of a new growth cycle for DeFi?</strong></h3>



<p>The current Yield Farming frenzy has some resemblances with the ICO frenzy of 2017, in which billions of dollars were invested across many tokens, which ultimately proved to be worthless.<strong> One of the main differences with today’s Governance Tokens is that these are being issued by protocols that <em>already have running products that provide value to the ecosystem</em>, instead of being outright scams.</strong> Even though it’s probable that today’s high yields will face a market correction and be lowered at some point, the current frenzy might still continue for some time. And as we have learned in the past, adoption increases after each frenzy: more users and developers are driven to the ecosystem, and the allocated capital funds the development of new innovations that are later used by a broader ecosystem.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Imagine you&#8217;re trying out a new DeFi project. Everything is going smoothly; the instructions on screen guide you, making you feel confident in your actions. That is until you complete your transaction and then your tokens don&#8217;t arrive. You start to get that sinking feeling in your stomach as you realize you&#8217;ve received tokens the wrong tokens&#8230;</p>



<p>Looking at your transaction confirmation you realize you received a token with the same name and ticker symbol as the one you thought you selected. In fact, upon reviewing the token selection menu you realize there are lots of inaccurate and confusing tokens listed. It&#8217;s a simple mistake but costly mistake anyone could make that leaves a sour taste in your mouth about the whole experience.</p>



<h4>So what happened?</h4>



<p>On Ethereum, anyone can create a token with any name or ticker symbol. It&#8217;s not like registering a username on a website; there&#8217;s no native mechanism preventing a new token from having the same name, symbol, or even icon as an existing token. Whether intentionally or not, duplicate or misleading tokens are created all the time making mistakes like the one described above more and more likely to occur for even the most experienced users.</p>



<p>Not to mention, DeFi grows so quickly that it&#8217;s practically impossible to keep up with the countless new tokens being produced by projects. DAI alone has over 30 variations. This situation isn&#8217;t slowing down anytime soon and a lot of collective time is being spent in our community right now playing detective in order to determine if a token is the right token.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/token-list-thumb-1-wo-padding.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8247" width="638" height="638"/></a></figure></div>



<h2>Meet The Token List</h2>



<p>The Token List provides an accurate list of authentic tokens submitted and curated by the community. Its purpose is to create a standard list of tokens that everyone can rely on. <strong>Anyone can apply to have a token added to The Token List as long as it isn’t likely to be confused with previously listed or well-known tokens. And, it&#8217;s free for anyone to integrate The Token List into their project.</strong></p>



<p>A reliable well-vetted token list serves as a source of truth for the community helping ensure users are never confused by misleading tokens or outright scams. The idea is that when you see a platform is using The Token List, you can be confident that the tokens available are the real deal.</p>



<h3>Implementation is fast, easy and forever free</h3>



<p>Integrating The Token List into your project is simple and worry-free with little to no maintenance. <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a> lets your team work smarter, not harder. No more wasting man hours on listing new tokens on top of maintaining the ever-growing list of existing tokens. And best of all, <strong>it&#8217;s forever free to use</strong> &#8211; no upfront cost or ongoing fees.</p>



<p>The Token List provides all the relevant information for each authentic token in JSON format: </p>



<ul><li>token name</li><li>contract address </li><li>ticker symbol </li><li>decimals</li><li>icon image</li><li>token standard (ERC20, ERC223, etc)</li><li>and flags describing token qualities such as: is it used in governance, is it a social token, etc.</li></ul>



<p>We handle the listing and maintenance for you so you can get back to building what matters.</p>



<h4>Got a token? Apply to The Token List in a snap.</h4>



<p>As previously mentioned, anyone can submit an application to list any authentic token to The Token List. Simply, visit <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a>, click the &#8216;Add a Token now!&#8217; button (powered by Unlock Protocol). It costs a flat fee of 0.05 ETH to apply. And then, follow the prompts to fill out the simple form with the required token details. </p>



<p>We review all applications for authenticity and to ensure that they are unique enough to not confuse the average user. We want to help improve user experience, not act as gatekeepers, so we&#8217;ll err on the side of inclusion where possible (but for the safety of the community we do reserve the right to reject outright scams or tokens intending to mislead, etc).</p>



<h3>Adaptive token selection</h3>



<p>Opening up the token listing process benefits all involved by making UX/UIs become more responsive and inclusive. Instead of acting as a potential gatekeepers, DeFi projects now become advocates of collaboration and empower their community to take ownership of the token listing process. Additionally, the community lends their watchful eyes to help maintain the accuracy and authenticity of existing token listings (because we know how fast some things change in DeFi).</p>



<h3>Collaboration and composability</h3>



<p>The ability to connect and combine existing smart contracts to create something new is a defining aspect of DeFi. We&#8217;re an industry built on collaboration which increases the pace of innovation. Projects and users alike benefit from keeping this shared list of tokens up-to-date with the latest listings and changes to existing tokens, potentially serving as a catalyst for even more composability between DeFi projects. Naturally, it&#8217;s easier to work together when you&#8217;re all on the same page. For example: when one project submits their newest token, it&#8217;s automatically added to all projects using The Token List.</p>



<h2>Take advantage of The Token List today</h2>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re hacking together an idea, tired of maintaining your current token listings, or want to make your token known to the world, <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a> is a simple but effective solution to meet your needs.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re really excited for this release and the potential impact an open, accessible standard token list could have on DeFi. Standards can improve quality of life and safety for users and make developers&#8217; work easier and more efficient. We&#8217;re also interested to see how this list will grow with community input. We&#8217;re 100% open to new ideas like new descriptive flags. So please let us know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/defipulse">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/Gx4TCTk">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/defipulse">Telegram</a>.</p>

<p>DeFi doesn&#8217;t just stand for decentralized finance; DeFi is a community of users, developers, investors, traders, researchers, writers, and so much more. Our collective endeavors are etched into the blockchain; our stories and shared history can be found in our data.</p>



<p>Ask anyone who&#8217;s familiar with DeFi and they&#8217;ll tell you that it&#8217;s been exhilarating to be a part of. Week by week, we&#8217;ve crossed milestones, set new records, and broken new ground. We set goals and then build towards them until they are fulfilled. Our community takes data from the blockchain and translates it into meaningful events that represent our community&#8217;s story and what it values.</p>



<p>At Concourse Open, we&#8217;ve witnessed this firsthand with our Total Value Locked metric. When we built DeFi Pulse a little over a year ago, we could have never imagined how well it would be received by the community. So many stories have been told with our data and illustrated with our charts. </p>

Because, we know the right data in the right hands can have a big impact on our community. </p>



<h3>How we utilize data determines our past, present, and future.</h3>



<p>The way we frame and interpret data points can tell a story, justify a design choice, confirm a hypothesize, and much much more. And when you examine our community, it couldn&#8217;t be clearer that our data represents our past actions but what we create  with that data determines our future.</p>



<p>We share in the triumph of moments like when the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi broke $1 Billion. We cheer together however our eyes are still looking toward the future.</p>

<p>We see that 1 BILLION and want to build bigger and better things to get to that next billion. The data taps into something deeply rooted in our brains and inspires us to keep moving forward.</p>



<p>And when times get tough, we look to the data to determine what happened and how to proceed.</p>

<p>And when it&#8217;s all said and done, we look to the data for answers. And the best of builders, react to the data accordingly looking to rewrite our future and build for a better, safer tomorrow. </p>

<p><strong><em>In this edition of DeFi Dive, Michael W. Burgess, Ren&#8217;s Head of Operations, discusses their team&#8217;s journey of bringing interoperability to DeFi.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I got into crypto early 2017 and one of the most obvious issues at that time was the lack of decentralized interoperability. </p>



<p>To this day there are lots of solutions out there to trade BTC for ETH/ERC20s/etc but none that embodied the whole point of crypto: trustlessness, permissionless, decentralization, and privacy. </p>



<p>With RenVM, smart contracts on any blockchain can control tokens on other blockchains, allowing DeFi to leverage the liquidity available anywhere and everywhere. It does all this without compromising trustlessness, permissionless, decentralization, or privacy.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>In the simplest terms, RenVM brings interoperability to DeFi. </p>



<p>The advantage over other solutions is its generic interoperability; meaning it works with any blockchain, not just a one-off solution. We already support BTC, BCH, and ZEC; with many more to come. </p>



<p>You can think of RenVM as a Tesla with over-the-air updates. Anytime we upgrade, add a feature, or new blockchain; applications that utilize RenVM will receive these benefits without lifting a finger. </p>



<p>Further, RenVM is composable. Meaning it serves as a plug-in for decentralized finance and therefore, any DeFi application can easily incorporate RenVM’s capabilities into their applications and existing smart contracts.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>DeFi Applications such as DEXes, Lending, Leveraging, etc</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>RenVM Mainnet is right around the corner, so we are working hard to bring it to fruition.</p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>With RenVM, a new narrative for the blockchain ecosystem rises. DeFi is no longer constrained, and a world of trustless value transfer exchange (regardless of blockchain) is born. </p>



<p>Bringing any digital assets to DeFi (Ethereum) regardless of blockchain, will have a profound impact on its dominance and ultimately solidify its role as the world&#8217;s settlement layer. International commerce is built on trust and given the world’s current fragmentation and lack thereof, it is one of the most important trust layer projects in existence today. </p>



<p>RenVM will help usher in this new paradigm.</p>



<h3>What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>The potential of composability is really quite exciting. </p>



<p>What DeFi will be able to achieve in a year&#8217;s time will dwarf the products traditional finance can offer. This is a really important step in an industry&#8217;s maturation.</p>



<h3>How can readers learn more about your product/service?</h3>



<p>Come find us on <a href="http://twitter.com/renprotocol">Twitter</a> and get excited because 2020 will be an exciting time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DefiPulse_Frontier-1-1024x512.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8010" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DefiPulse_Frontier-1-1024x512.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DefiPulse_Frontier-1-300x150.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DefiPulse_Frontier-1-768x384.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DefiPulse_Frontier-1-1536x768.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DefiPulse_Frontier-1-1568x784.png 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/DefiPulse_Frontier-1.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong><em>We spoke with Frontier Co-Founder &amp; Head of Marketing Palash Jain who longs to bring DeFi to the masses with slick features like</em></strong> <strong>TxLink.<em><br></em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I first heard about Ethereum back in 2017, and that&#8217;s where my crypto journey started. Entered into this space out of curiosity and ended up finding the fit in this space. Since then, I have worked with promising start-ups in the space, helping them on the Marketing and the growth end. Now Leading Marketing and Growth at Frontier to bring DeFi to masses.<br></p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>What are you building and what sets it apart? To briefly introduce, Frontier is a mobile-first, user-facing application. Frontier natively integrates multiple DeFi Protocols and wallets, making it super easy for users to Track, View and Manage positions across various DeFi protocols in real-time without having to give away private keys. </p>



<p>Frontier&#8217;s focus is bringing DeFi to Mobile, and that&#8217;s what sets us apart. We offer Native UI/UX for dApps and protocols and native wallet integration on Mobile. To bring wallet composability on mobile we came up with TxLink a middleware which enables Frontier to connect with multiple wallets such that user can choose the preferred wallet to sign transactions, thereby the user never gives away the private key nor has to import wallet. </p>



<p>If we look at the current way of interacting with dApps on Mobile, the experience is slow and sluggish on dApp browsers, and if there&#8217;s a product which offers native integration of dApps, perhaps the user has to create or import wallet onto that App. The user keeps hopping from one app to another app in search of perfect DeFi experience on Mobile. With Frontier, we remove this pain point by giving the user the options to choose existing wallets to transact with and better UI/UX experience.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>Our current users are sophisticated Defi users that are aiming for maximising their returns from their investments in this space. However, what brings Defi users to Frontier is the app simplicity and its user-friendliness, hence everyone&#8217;s invited to make the most of this space. </p>



<p>DeFi is for everyone and so is Frontier.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>There’s a lot of exciting stuff which we are working on, our focus for the coming months is to integrate leading DeFi protocols such as MakerDao(Native Vaults module and DSR), Synthetix(Native Mintr), Compound, KAVA. Extend support to more wallets such as Gnosis Safe, Coinbase wallet. Gasless transactions for all DeFi operations via Frontier, and introduce Native staking for PoS and dPos based chains such as Matic Network.<br></p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>Frontier being a user-facing product, aims to bring DeFi to masses! Making it easy for users to access multiple financial protocols giving them the options to choose products based on their risk appetite. DeFi Bank which is open 24/7</p>



<h3>What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of awesome stuff people are building in this space! Every single day is exciting in DeFi. Folks should look into Ren protocol &#8211; inter-blockchain liquidity for all dApps bringing BTC to Ethereum ecosystem and of course Frontier, every DeFi user must have this App <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="😀" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DAI is an ERC20 token designed to maintain a peg to the US Dollar, also known as a stablecoin, generated and maintained by the <a href="https://makerdao.com/">Maker Protocol</a>. Every single DAI in existence has been generated by users <a href="https://defipulse.com/maker">locking collateral into Maker&#8217;s smart contract system</a> and opening what&#8217;s called a Vault.</p>



<p>When you open a Maker Vault, you lock in collateral such as ether (ETH) or BAT. And then, you’re able to generate or borrow up to 2/3 of the US dollar value of your collateral in DAI. In other words, your Vault&#8217;s ratio of collateral value to total debt in DAI must be above 150%.</p>



<p>For every 1 DAI, there is at least $1.50 worth of collateral locked into a Maker Vault. And if your collateral value falls, you must lock in more ETH, pay back some of your debt, or risk having the collateral in your Vault liquidated. When a Vault position is liquidated, the held collateral is automatically sold to pay back the debts in addition to a penalty fee for failing to keep your collateral ratio above 150%.</p>



<h2>Using Maker&#8217;s Oasis portal to borrow your first DAI</h2>



<p><strong>Navigate to Maker&#8217;s <a href="https://oasis.app/borrow">Oasis Borrow</a>.</strong><br>There are many ways to interface with a Maker Vault; Oasis is <a href="https://github.com/OasisDEX">open-source</a> and was developed by the Maker. </p>



<p><strong>Connect the wallet of your choice and click &#8216;Get Started&#8217;</strong><br><a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> is a browser extension commonly recommended for interacting with many DApps. Ledger and Trezor are hardware wallets. Wallet Connect and Coinbase Wallet allow you to scan a QR code to access Oasis via mobile wallet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019-1-1024x508.png" alt="" data-id="7995" data-full-url="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019-1.png" data-link="https://defipulse.com/blog/?attachment_id=7995" class="wp-image-7995"/></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><strong>Select a collateral type and click &#8216;Continue&#8217;</strong><br>ETH and BAT are the only supported collateral types as of writing this. In this example, we selected ETH.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999017-1-1024x510.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7996"/></figure>



<p><strong>Setup Vault and Set Allowance</strong><br>Follow the prompts to send a few transactions in preparation for opening your Maker Vault and generating DAI. We recommend referencing <a href="http://ethgasstation.info/">EthGasStation</a> for the latest gas prices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999016-1-1024x511.png" alt="" data-id="7997" data-full-url="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999016-1.png" data-link="https://defipulse.com/blog/?attachment_id=7997" class="wp-image-7997"/></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><strong>Deposit Collateral and Generate Dai</strong><br>Enter the amount of collateral you&#8217;d like to deposit and the amount of DAI you wish to generate. You cannot withdraw the collateral until you pay back any DAI you generate or borrow. Note, opening a Vault requires a minimum of 20 Dai to be generated. Click continue and confirm your transaction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999018-1024x510.png" alt="" data-id="7998" data-full-url="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999018.png" data-link="https://defipulse.com/blog/?attachment_id=7998" class="wp-image-7998"/></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><strong>Wait for your newly generated DAI to arrive in your wallet</strong><br>Once submitted, your transaction may take a moment depending on the gas price you paid. Finally, your transaction will be confirmed and your DAI should be available in your wallet.</p>



<h3>What can I use DAI for?</h3>



<p>DAI is one of the most liquid assets in the DeFi ecosystem. You can spend, save, lend, and tons more with your DAI. You can trade DAI for ETH, MKR, and many other ERC20 tokens at the best prices in DeFi using a DEX aggregator like <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a>.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">earn interest</a> by lending out your DAI on other DeFi lending protocols. Remember to keep in mind the stability fees you&#8217;ll owe on any DAI you generate or borrow from your Vault. And also, consider the various risks involved in lending some of which we cover in our <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/zero-to-defi-cdai/">Zero to DeFi</a> guide.</p>



<p>Another way to earn interest is to deposit DAI into Maker&#8217;s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dsr-dai-savings-rate/">Dai Savings Rate</a> (DSR). The DSR allows users to lock in DAI to earn a variable interest rate. However, don&#8217;t go generating DAI just to deposit it into the DSR because the DSR is designed to be lower than the stability fee. <a href="https://oasis.app/save">Learn more</a> about the Dai Savings Rate.</p>



<p>You&#8217;d be surprised the many interesting ways you can use your DAI! Explore <a href="https://github.com/makerdao/awesome-makerdao#dai-1">a full list of ecosystem resources</a> composed by the Maker community.</p>

<p><strong><em>Alex Miles, co-founder of TokenTax, discusses his quest to ease the crypto community&#8217;s DeFi tax woes.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I first heard about bitcoin while i was in university around 2010, but didn’t mine or purchase any (fml). I bought my first half bitcoin in 2013. Fast forward to 2017, I started trading and casually buying/selling alt coins, I realized that calculating taxes on my activity would be very complicated. </p>



<p>Over the course of a month in 2017, I built a simple demo application that linked your coinbase account and calculated your cost basis data. The application then generated a filled out 8949. I showed it to a few friends and they were really happy with the experience. I submitted what I built to the 2017 Product Hunt Global Hackathon and ended up winning the grand prize! </p>



<p>After that, I partnered with my co-founder Zac McClure who has a background in finance, accounting, and impact investing. Together we formed a plan to take TokenTax to the next level. A lot of our initial plan is now built and we plan to continue to grow the business.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>We are building the easiest way for cryptocurrency users to calculate and file their crypto taxes. At TokenTax we are intensely focused on building the best tax experience for DeFi. We believe DeFi has the potential to bring mainstream adoption to cryptocurrency and we want to do everything in our power to help make this a reality.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>Any cryptocurrency or DeFi user! We are an international crypto tax calculator so we support any country, not just the US.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>I’m excited to continue to build out our DeFi tax tools. These are open to the public and can be used to download your transaction history for popular DeFi apps like Uniswap or compound. Every popular DeFi app in in the works like dYdX, Chai, and Maker to name a few <br>&#8211; <a href="https://tokentax.co/compound-finance">https://tokentax.co/compound-finance</a> <br>&#8211; <a href="https://tokentax.co/uniswap">https://tokentax.co/uniswap </a></p>



<p>We also have built a wonderful knowledge base of guides and help articles. We are working full time to build our more helpful resources:<br>&#8211; <a href="https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/">https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/</a></p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>We plan on being the tax and reporting backbone behind DeFi. We want to help legitimize DeFi in the eyes of our government authorities around the world by providing users with excellent documentation.</p>



<h3>What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>Honestly, I think one of the best things the DeFi community has, is the people within the community. There’s so much creativity and passion being shared online and I think this helps fuel a ton of innovation. I think we often forget we’re all on the same team. We should try to fight less about small topics that don’t matter. We need to remember who we are fighting against.</p>

<p><strong><em>Off the heels of Aave Protocol storming DeFi Pulse&#8217;s rankings, Stani Kulechov founder and CEO of Aave joins us today</em></strong>.</p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I first got into crypto because of the Ethereum community back when I was in college. I was studying Law, but I my true passion has always been finance. When you look at the traditional financial system, there are many inefficiencies. I wanted to build an ecosystem where people have control over their money, and finance is transparent and open.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>We released Aave Protocol nearly a month ago, and already we have over 5 million USD liquidity locked in our protocol. Aave provides a money lending market similar to Compound, but instead of just focusing on the total locked amount of assets, Aave re-uses locked assets within the Ethereum ecosystem. We wanted to come up with innovative tools that utilize the assets in different ways, and that’s how we came up with flash loans. Flash loans are a tool for developers to borrow liquidity from the protocol without needing to put up any collateral, provided that the liquidity is returned to the protocol within one transaction (a single block). You can use flash loans to do some fancy arbitraging, refinancing, and much more. The use-cases people come up with are super cool, because you can really apply them in creative ways. The end goal for flash loans is to help developers build financial products without needing capital, enabling more people to build and lowering the barrier to entry.</p>



<p>Another exciting feature is our Aave interest-bearing tokens called “aTokens”. When someone deposits an asset in Aave Protocol, a smart contract mints an equivalent amount of aTokens, which are pegged 1:1 to the underlying asset and are sent to the lender. For example, if you deposit 200 Dai, you will get 200 aDai in your wallet. The underlying asset, in this case the 200 Dai, is loaned out to borrowers while the aDai accrue interest in real time directly in your wallet. You can redirect this interest at any time to any Ethereum address, putting you in control over your earnings.</p>



<p>Aave Protocol also lets users switch between stable and variable rates when borrowing, so that the interest-rate is always on your side. Stable rates give the user more certainty than variable rates, which can fluctuate a lot. You can always switch—if you have a variable rate and the rate starts going up, you can switch to the stable rate, for example.</p>



<p>We knew we needed to offer new features with Aave Protocol. You can’t just do the same thing as everyone else—in order to get people into DeFi you need to come up with new tools that can really benefit users.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>Everyone! We want to bring DeFi into the mainstream, but we understand that there are some hurdles to this, such as education, since people can find anything “blockchain” intimidating and people do not understand the value of DeFi yet. Right now, our main users are devs, especially since some tools like flashloans are designed specifically for people with some technical knowledge. However, anyone can use Aave protocol to earn interest on their crypto or borrow assets.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>We are very excited to hand over the governance to the community of LEND holders. Currently, Aave is keeping the governance in case there are any issues with the protocol, but it has been built and will be released to the public very soon. LEND holders will have voting power and be able to make important decisions regarding the governance of the protocol.</p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>We want to bring DeFi into the mainstream conscience by building tools that people can really use, and want to use, to control their money. Money should never just sleep in a traditional bank account when you can put it in DeFi and earn some interest, borrow, etc. People want to have control over their finances and see their money working for them 24/7. They also value transparency and openness, which you don’t necessarily get in the old-school financial system.</p>



<h3>What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>I think people should be looking at uncollateralized loan options, like Aave protocol’s flash loans. DeFi usually relies on overcollateralized loans, but this requires borrowers to put up tons of collateral, which not everybody has. Uncollateralized loans make it easier for people to borrow and doesn’t require lots of capital, making it more accessible.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Felix Feng, Co-Founder and CEO of Set Protocol, sat down with us today to discuss the future of asset management....]]></description>

<p><em><strong>Felix Feng, Co-Founder and CEO of Set Protocol, sat down with us today to discuss the future of asset management.</strong></em></p>
<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build Set Protocol?</h3>
<p>I first heard about crypto during the bull market in 2013 when Bitcoin went from $100 to $1300. When I studied abroad in Milan, I had the chance to attend Bitcoin 2014, the annual Bitcoin conference. I listened to many of the technical presentations, met early companies like Coinbase and figures like Charlie Lee. I left that event convinced crypto was going to change the financial/legal industries to same way that the internet changed media and communications industries.</p>
<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve gone down the rabbit hole, working at 21.co, starting an angel syndicate called Turing Capital, and since then Set.</p>
<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>
<p>Set is a protocol that makes fund strategies easy and accessible. We built TokenSets, which is the first interface where you can acquire a Set with a few clicks of a button. Today, you can get simple strategies like an Index and more complicated technical analysis strategies like a Moving Average Crossover.&nbsp;Recently, we launched Set Social Trading on TokenSets which allows traders to effectively tokenize their strategies. Users can buy into traders Sets and gain automated exposure to their strategy.</p>
<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>
<p>The amateur investor or trader would find our products useful &#8211; those who understand the power of implementing a strategy, but don&#8217;t necessarily have the knowledge, effort, or skills to do it.</p>
<h3>What future event or feature on your road map are you most excited for?</h3>
