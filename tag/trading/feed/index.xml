										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Did you know that the combination of how the Earth’s gravity warps spacetime and the speed at which a satellite travels effectively allows satellites to time travel into the future nanoseconds at time? If you wanted to time travel, theoretically you’d need two things: a massive black hole and and an incredibly fast spacecraft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many have described DeFi as a liquidity black hole, sucking in anything that comes near it. And now, there’s a craft capable of speeds fast enough to <em>slingshot</em> us into the future. <a href="https://app.slingshot.finance/"><strong>Slingshot</strong></a><strong> is a next generation decentralized trading platform which aggregates the top liquidity sources in order to give traders like you the best prices, speed and execution on trades.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In late February, Slingshot launched its closed beta with a unique way for users to earn their invite. The first 100 players to complete the race, a sci-fi themed browser game, won access to the beta and NFT prizes for having the best speedrun times. One player even finished the race so quickly they were <a href="https://twitter.com/AgentProtocol/status/1365828515489345537">accused of being a robot</a>. While a race may seem odd, it was arguably the perfect primer for the futuristic look and feel of Slingshot’s smooth trading interface.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://slingshot.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="443" height="46" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9291" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo.png 443w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-logo-300x31.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 443px) 100vw, 443px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>You can now try it for yourself today because <a href="https://app.slingshot.finance/"><strong>Slingshot</strong></a><strong> is live on Polygon</strong>. Slingshot chose to launch their first Liquidity Zone on Polygon because it fit with their mission to provide traders with the best trading experience.</p>



<h2>Slingshot is tailored for a next level trading experience</h2>



<p>To quote its early <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1329235851813953537">teaser</a> video, Slingshot wants you to “fall in love with DeFi all over again.” And to be honest, the video game-like UI/UX of Slingshot is rather alluring. Between the live price chart, trade history, scrolling price ticker, and all the flashes of red and green when token prices update, you feel like you’re behind the console of a trading machine.</p>



<p>Speedrunning was indeed an apt way to introduce users to Slingshot, a trading platform built for speed. The flow of trading on Slingshot is rather intuitive. You can either start by searching for a token to trade using the search bar or click the + sign on the left side to bookmark a token. Next, select whether you want to buy or sell and the amount you want to spend. And voila, Slingshot finds you the best price for your trade aggregated from the top liquidity sources.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://app.slingshot.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="506" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-1024x506.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9293" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-1024x506.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-300x148.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-768x379.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-1536x759.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1-585x289.png 585w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/slingshot-ui-1.png 1917w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure></div>



<h3>A polished UI with a buttery smooth trade flow</h3>



<p>When trading bookmarked tokens, this entire process flows smoothly from left to right allowing you to trade incredibly fast, especially on Polygon. While Polygon is the only publicly available Liquidity Zone today, beta users can tell you how awesome it is to seamlessly switch between Liquidity Zones. Slingshot allows you to search for tokens across Liquidity Zones and then filters the list of available tokens according to the Liquidity Zone of the token you selected. So say you’re connected to Ethereum but want to buy MATIC on Polygon. There’s no need to pre-switch your network in Metamask because Slingshot handles this as part of the trade flow. Don’t worry though; you’ll get the chance to see what this is like soon enough.</p>



<p>The more subtle details in the user interface also really add polish to the entire trading experience. For example, when you hover your mouse over the ticker at the top, it feels as if time slows as the scrolling ticker slows in reaction to your cursor. And when you hover over the chart, the cursor becomes a crosshair which follows the line of the price chart. Every little bit adds up to make trading frictionless and fun again.</p>



<h2>Test drive the future of trading with Slingshot</h2>

<p>This AMA session with Slingshot CEO Clinton Bembry Jr. occurred on May 7th, 2021. The following is a transcription of the live from DeFi Pulse’s AMA Discord channel. To participate in future AMAs, please join our <a href="https://discord.gg/Gx4TCTk">Discord</a> and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/defipulse">Twitter</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Chaz Schmidt:<em> </em></strong><em>Hello and welcome @everyone! Thank you for joining us today for an AMA with Clinton Bembry Jr., CEO of Slingshot ( @Clinton | Slingshot ).&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>The AMA will last around 30 minutes and will be made available shortly after for those who could not attend.</em></p>



<p><em>Clinton will be answering the questions we&#8217;ve collected from the community throughout the week. A special thanks to those of you who submitted questions for today&#8217;s AMA.</em><strong><em><br></em></strong><strong><em><br></em></strong><strong>How&#8217;s it going Clinton?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton Bembry Jr.:</strong> Hey Chaz! doing well, hbu?</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Not too shabby. Thanks everyone for showing up for the AMA. Let&#8217;s start off with a rather easy question&#8230;</em></p>



<p><strong>What is Slingshot?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton:</strong> sweet, Slingshot is a decentralized trading platform that aggregates liquidity across DEX protocols (like uniswap, sushiswap, curve, etc.) to offer user sthe best prices on their trades. We place a huge emphasis on user-experience and aim to offer the ultimate trading experience for both DeFi natives and newcomers to crypto!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>This next one comes from the Slingshot Discord where folks are clamoring for more details on Slingshot ever since your initial teaser earlier this year.</em></p>



<p><strong>What will separate Slingshot from all other DEXes already operating? Uniswap, SushiSwap, LinkSwap, DODO, etc.</strong><br><br><strong>Clinton:</strong> so Slingshot itself isn&#8217;t a DEX, we plug our liquidity engine into other DEXes like uniswap and sushiswap etc</p>



<p>By aggregating liquidity and splitting orders between other DEXes we are able to offer much better prices than if you were to trade on an individual DEX<br><br>Slingshot isn&#8217;t just about the best prices, but also unparalleled user-experience</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I know for many DeFi users fees can be a big factor when it comes to user experience.</em><br><br><strong>How does Slingshot plan to support trading on layer 2 or multiple chains?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>definitely, many people (myself included) got priced out of trading on Ethereum L1</p>



<p>At launch we will suport trading on Polygon, which is an Ethereum L2/sidechain. The tx fee on Polygon for a trade is as low as $0.0002, compared to Ethereum which can be a $100+ fee per trade</p>



<p>At Slingshot we&#8217;re all about pricing people back into DeFi <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong><em> Sounds good to me. I like low fees. I saw in your Discord that Closed Beta users have been able to use Slingshot on Polygon already.</em></p>



<p><strong>What has been the most useful feedback from the closed beta so far?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton:</strong> Our polygon support is a result of the feedback we received from our earliest beta users. Due to high fees they were being forced to turn back to the world centralized trading. We began working on L2 support immediately and shipped it a few weeks later.</p>



<p>other than that &#8211; it&#8217;s been very helpful in general to hear which features users want to see to aid in their trading flows</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>That actually leads straight into my next question which is:</em><strong> What features of Slingshot are you most excited for the public to see?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>aside from the lightning fast L2 trading + unbeatable prices, i&#8217;m personally excited for people to experience all of the real-time, on-chain data we pump through our platform.</p>



<p>Every time a block get&#8217;s mined we parse all trading activity and surface it to our users and it makes for a visceral experience!</p>



<p>oh also &#8211; our price charts are custom made and look really cool :sunglasses:</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I can attest to this personally. I&#8217;ve gotten a chance to test Slingshot in the beta and I found myself getting lost in it like it is a game. The flow from seeing a price change on the ticker, clicking it to select the token, and executing the trade was incredible. A community member wanted to know more about the sci-fi browser game that Slingshot produced where players could win their way into the beta.</em><strong> In their words, &#8220;What was the point of the game?&#8221; And, will other aspects of Slingshot involve gamification?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>the point of the game was&nbsp; to announce our closed-beta and bootstrap an initial user-base, while also having some fun while we build the future of finance!<br><br>I mean, how else are you supposed to announce a beta?</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Solid point haha</em><br><br><em>And it was fun. One player was even so fast they were accused of being a robot</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f916.png" alt="🤖" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>haha yes, a bit of a speed-running competition broke out! as far as I could tell, they were all legit, no bots!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>We&#8217;re reaching near the end now and it&#8217;s been super interesting so far. If you&#8217;re up for it Clinton, we have a couple more of questions before we let you go</em></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>Of course!<br><br><strong>CS: </strong><em>I think the audience would get angry if I didn&#8217;t ask the obvious: </em><strong>When launch?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>soon <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> bahaha<br>forreal though &#8211; very soon<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>We&#8217;ll accept that answer.</em><br><br><strong>Clinton: </strong>we want to get Slingshout out publicly for everyone to use ASAP</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I think that&#8217;s about all the questions we have time for.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you for joining us Clinton. I know I for one am excited for Slingshot to go live.</em></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>awesome, thanks for having me!</p>



<p>quick plug &#8211; we&#8217;re hiring for a lot of roles at Slingshot. If you&#8217;re interested in helping us build the future of trading, <a href="https://slingshot-finance.homerun.co/">check out our job postings here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Haha yes. Be sure to reach out if you fit those roles lol</em></p>



<p><strong>Anything else you&#8217;d like to add before we go?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>that&#8217;s all from me!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Well it was a pleasure talking with you</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you everyone for attending! I hope your curiosities were satisfied.</em></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The origin of the Sanskrit word <em>guru</em> is said to be based on the syllables<em> gu</em> (गु) and <em>ru</em> (रु), which stand for darkness and &#8220;light that dispels it.&#8221; Gurus cast out the darkness of ignorance with the light of their wisdom. To become a guru, you must be able to take in your surroundings to gain perspective and glean greater wisdom. DexGuru wants to be your guide lighting the way through the dark forest. <a href="https://dex.guru/">DexGuru</a> harmonizes permissionless, real-time data and analytics of every on-chain market in a single UI capable of trading across DEXes.</p>



<h2>Trade with more awareness with real-time on-chain market data</h2>



<p>It’s 2021. Traders like you need more than a simple From / To interface when it comes to determining how and when to execute your strategy. <a href="https://dex.guru/">DexGuru</a> offers a better way to monitor on-chain markets for any token on Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Pancakeswap. Traders using DexGuru have permissionless access to data in real-time including charting, liquidity, pool activity, trading volume, and trading history. So what does permissionless access mean to you? It means you can copy and paste any token address into DexGuru’s search bar and tap into loads of information generated from analysis of on-chain trading activity for free.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://dex.guru/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9147" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1536x864.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1568x882.png 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>We might be biased towards the color purple here but&#8230; DexGuru is rather sleek looking, combining various data feeds into a responsive and appealing UI/UX. View charts and trading data in real-time for any token as trades occur to stay more informed with what’s happening on-chain. Want to know more about the token you’re viewing? Simply click the DYOR button at the top of the page and get a rundown of that token’s basic info and community links. Beyond price and trade history, traders and farmers alike can utilize real-time liquidity data to monitor when liquidity is added or removed from pools. Not to mention, DexGuru can give you insights into the behaviors of other traders in the market, but we’ll get to that later.</p>



<h3>Become one with the flow &#8211; executing trades on multiple chains from one UI</h3>



<p>Under the hood, DexGuru uses the 0x API to provide users with gas-efficient order routing. Connect your wallet and select your network to buy and sell tokens on EVM-compatible chains. There is no more waiting for token listings because DexGuru permissionlessly indexes each token market. In other words, when it is added to the DEX, it’s added to DexGuru. </p>



<p>Trade orders are routed through any 0x API connected exchange including Uniswap, Kyber, Curve, Balancer, CREAM, Bancor, mStable, Shell, Swerve, SnowSwap, SushiSwap, DODO, Mooniswap(1inch protocol AMM), PancakeSwap, BakerySwap, Mooniswap, DODO_V2, SushiSwap, Nerve Finance, Belt Finance, and Ellipsis.</p>



<h2>Gain more insight with DexGuru’s real-time on-chain analytics</h2>



<p>One of the most interesting features DexGuru has to offer is the deeper analysis it performs on user trading history. DexGuru is constantly monitoring on-chain markets for new trades. When a new trade is received, DexGuru analyzes the trader’s address and marks it with a special emoji in the pool activity or trading history.</p>

<p>Options trading has become more popular than ever now that anyone can trade from anywhere with a few taps. The barriers to entry have been lowered improving accessibility for the average joe. In case you don’t know, options are financial primitives that give a trader the choice (or the <em>option</em>) to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined strike price at some point in the future. Traders can utilize options to hedge against potential price changes or to speculate on the future price of an asset. As DeFi matures, on-chain financial primitives like options become the building blocks for even more sophisticated financial instruments.</p>



<p>If options trading is what floats your boat, say ahoy to SIREN, a decentralized protocol aiming to carve out a unique market niche by catering specifically to sophisticated users interested in holding and actively trading tokenized options contracts. This nautical-themed on-chain options marketplace launched its alpha release in December 2020 and is about to embark on the next chapter of its journey. <strong><a href="http://sirenmarkets.com/">SIREN Markets</a> is set to launch on mainnet March 1.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="500" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/siren-1000x500-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8932" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/siren-1000x500-1.jpg 1000w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/siren-1000x500-1-300x150.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/siren-1000x500-1-768x384.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<h2>SIREN Markets offer seamless on-chain options trading</h2>



<p>SIREN is a decentralized protocol which facilitates a marketplace of fully-collateralized, on-chain options. SIREN protocol tokenizes both the long and short sides of an options contract as ERC20 tokens which enables options to be traded via its AMM design requiring no third-party settling mechanism or order matching to complete option settlement on chain. Siren AMM v2 can trade up to 6 SIREN options contracts which all share collateral and payment assets in a single pool. This enables liquidity to be rolled over when a market expires for a seamless UX for liquidity providers.</p>



<p>It starts with liquidity providers depositing collateral into the SIREN AMM pool. So for the WBTC/USDC calls the collateral asset would be WBTC. When you as a trader go to buy options from the AMM, the collateral held within the pool is used to mint a pair of tokens: bToken and wToken. bToken, which stands for buyToken, is sent to the buyer and gives the holder the right to purchase or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined strike price. While wToken, short for writeToken, stays in the pool. If the option is left unexercised, wTokens allow the holder to withdraw the collateral or withdraw the exercise payment from the contract after expiration.</p>



<p>Note, that SIREN AMM v2 only trades bTokens, but not wTokens. Although, the Siren team has stated that trading of wTokens may become available in the future. Users pay a premium to the pool in the collateral asset each time they make a trade. This process results in liquidity providers passively becoming covered option writers, automatically underwriting contracts to meet demand from traders. In addition to collecting premiums, liquidity providers benefit from any slippage in AMM trades and earn SI token rewards from the SIREN <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/expanding-the-siren-lpp-c69969e25d41">Liquidity Provider Program (LPP)</a>. It’s always worth noting <a href="https://docs.sirenmarkets.com/faq/what-is-a-liquidity-provider#risks">the risks associated with providing liquidity</a>.</p>



<h3>Giving sophisticated options traders the right tools for the job</h3>



<p>The tools that options traders have come to rely on in traditional finance were refined over decades and decades. So it only makes sense that these early days of DeFi provide ample opportunity to incorporate and innovate on these tools. SIREN’s design allows traders to easily swap options in and out in order to build complex positions as well as the necessary information to assess those positions.</p>



<h4><strong>SIREN AMM v2 pricing is time-decay-aware</strong></h4>



<p>There are two factors that determine the price of each trade on SIREN v2: spot price and slippage. The spot price is determined using a Black-Scholes model, which takes into account parameters like the underlying price, time to expiration, option strike and implied volatility, coupled with a Chainlink price oracle. Utilizing this formula allows Siren Markets to be time-decay-aware requiring no arbitrage in order to quote reasonable prices. Similar to other AMMs, trades will be impacted by slippage based on the size of the trade and available assets in the pool. In other words, the larger the trade relative to the size of the pool, the higher the slippage. This slippage ultimately benefits liquidity providers as another source of returns for liquidity providers on top of collecting option premiums.</p>



<h4><strong>What is ITM, ATM and OTM?</strong></h4>



<p>These expressions are likely familiar to options traders so we’ll skim through these rather quickly. For more in-depth info, you can refer to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inthemoney.asp">Investopedia’s definitions</a>. An ITM (short for ‘in the money’) option which has value because it has a favorable strike price compared to the current market price. As you can probably guess, an OTM (short for ‘out of the money’) option still needs to reach its strike price whereas an ATM (short for ‘at the money’) has reached the strike price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These terms help determine what kind of options traders buy or sell taking into account how that option might behave in the current market. For example, an ITM call may require a smaller rise in the cryptocurrency price to be profitable, but there is less potential upside compared to an ATM or OTM call. So if you believe the market price is going to rise significantly, you might consider buying an OTM call because you’d have a greater potential upside while limiting exposure to loss if the price fell.</p>



<p>These are just a couple examples of the ways traders can make use of different option characteristics to influence their trading strategy. Greeks are another way options traders can assess an option.</p>



<h4><strong>Meet the Greeks</strong></h4>



<p>As Siren is meant for experienced options traders, we’re only going to give a brief overview of <a href="https://docs.sirenmarkets.com/faq/what-are-the-greeks">how option Greeks apply to Siren Markets</a>. To get caught up to speed, you can learn more about these general concepts <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/trading/getting-to-know-the-greeks/">here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Delta</strong></p>



<p>Delta measures a ratio comparing the difference between the underlying asset price relative to the strike price of the option. The delta of a long call is positive; the delta of a long put is negative. The delta is reversed for short calls and puts. Delta is only a theoretical approximation of your exposure in the underlying asset.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Gamma</strong></p>



<p>If you imagine delta as the &#8220;speed&#8221; of your option position, gamma is the &#8220;acceleration.” The gamma of long options, calls or puts, is always positive; of short options, always negative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more gamma your position has, your position delta can change a great deal and probably needs close monitoring. Gamma is highest for the ATM strike, and slopes off toward the ITM and OTM strikes.</p>



<p>If you think the price of an underlying asset is about to change quickly, you want to buy an option with relatively high gamma. For example, the higher the gamma, the more delta if the underlying asset price moves the way you want it to, and vice versa.</p>



<p><strong>Theta</strong></p>



<p>As touched on before, Theta measures the rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time sometimes referred to as time decay. No one can escape time, not even options. Time decay describes how long calls and puts have negative theta, losing money as time goes on. Short calls and puts are the opposite having positive theta and making money as time passes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Theta is highest for the ATM strike, and slopes off to the ITM and OTM options, and responds to the passage of time and changes in volatility the same way that gamma does. The theta of options is indirectly proportional to gamma. When gamma is big and positive, theta tends to be big and negative. That&#8217;s the trade-off. A position that has a lot of gamma (good for fast changing underlying assets) also has lots of theta that is continuously eroding its value.</p>



<p><strong>Vega</strong></p>



<p>Vega is how much the value of an option changes when the implied volatility of that option changes. Long calls and puts both have positive vega and profit when implied volatility rises. Inversely, short calls and puts both have negative vega and profit when implied volatility falls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The more time there is until expiration, the higher the vega is for an option. Vega also depends on where the price of the underlying asset is relative to the strike price of the option. Like gamma and theta, vega is highest for the ATM options, and drops for the OTM and ITM options. So, ATM options with lots of time to expiration are the most sensitive to changes in implied volatility.</p>



<h2>SIREN Governance</h2>



<p>The SIREN Market project was created to bring the features and tools options traders are familiar with from traditional finance to a seamless on-chain experience without sacrificing autonomy. The Siren team understands that a platform built to cater to sophisticated users only benefits from their feedback and collaboration. And so, SIREN’s native token SI is designed to reward early users placing the future of the platform in their hands via protocol governance. Liquidity providers, traders, and market makers will receive SI token rewards in exchange for their participation. By design, the most experienced and knowledgeable users will be given the most influence over the platform to help respond to future market demands.</p>



<p>The SI community will be able to create new option markets and determine the fee rate for writing, closing, and redeeming an option. These fees accrue to SI token holders; although it should be noted that upon launch these fees will be set to 0 to reduce the friction for users looking to explore SIREN Markets.</p>



<p>The first SIREN Liquidity Provider Program (LPP) began in December 2020 and was <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/expanding-the-siren-lpp-c69969e25d41">extended through May 2021</a>. Find out more about SIREN’s SI token and liquidity providing program <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/si-token-distribution-event-cff0be106fc6">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Roadmap</h2>



<p>Looking toward the future, <a href="https://sirenmarkets.medium.com/si-token-distribution-event-cff0be106fc6">SIREN’S roadmap</a> details many future upgrades to the platform like expanding the list of available asset pools. SIREN is considering adding SUSHI/USDC, UNI/USDC, YFI/USDC, LINK/USDC pools starting with Sushi. Even further out, SIREN protocol will be modified to allow yield-generating assets to be used as collateral.</p>



<p>Other improvements which option traders may want to keep their eye out for include future interfaces for constructing option spreads and effecting basket trades natively. SIREN also plans to explore layer 2 solutions to improve efficiency and lower fees for its users.</p>



<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>



<p>DeFi is disruptive because it gives everyone access to the same tools and data as the experts. Many users who had never had never previously owned a share in a company or a treasury bond are now active participants in a new financial paradigm. With the increasing popularity of options trading in traditional finance, it stands to reason that on-chain options may play a bigger role as DeFi reaches more widespread adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It boils down to: Do you desire a more sophisticated options trading experience? If so, SIREN would like to invite you to join them in building a platform that suits your needs. This is an opportunity to influence the platform early in its development. <strong><a href="http://sirenmarkets.com/">SIREN Markets</a> is set to go live on mainnet on March 1, 2021. </strong>If you want to know more, we recommend joining SIREN’S <a href="https://t.me/sirenmarkets">Telegram</a> or following them on <a href="https://twitter.com/sirenprotocol">Twitter</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>During DeFi’s most innovative and exciting year, a new kind of trading experience has exploded onto the scene. <a href="https://www.hegic.co/">Hegic</a> is an on-chain, non-custodial platform for options trading, launched by the enigmatic Molly Wintermute. The platform has grown significantly in recent months, after its <a href="https://decrypt.co/35038/hegics-molly-wintermute-im-paying-a-high-price-for-the-mainnet-first-approach-to-building">inauspicious start </a>in April. The first iteration suffered from buggy code, which required Wintermute to return almost $50,000 in locked funds to users. Since then, Hegic has been running smoothly, and volume has <a href="https://www.hegic.co/analytics">rapidly grown</a>. It is poised to become one of the key players in the crypto trading ecosystem.</p>



<p>Hegic allows users to buy put and call options on ETH and WBTC. Currently, total options volume for WBTC exceeds that of ETH. For those who are unfamiliar with options trading, calls and puts are essentially bets on the future price of assets. Buying a call means you have the right but not the obligation to purchase an asset at a certain price (the “strike price”) for an agreed-upon length of time. You pay a premium to purchase the option. </p>



<p>Let’s say you buy a call for ETH at $500. The call option expires one month later. If the price of ETH shoots up to $1,000 during this window of time, you can exercise the option for a profit of $500 less the premium cost. Put options work the opposite way. You reserve the right but are not required to sell $ETH at $500 one month later. If ETH plummets to $250 during this time, you can go buy some ETH at market price then turn around and sell it for $500 as agreed. You profit $250 minus the premium you paid. Premium costs depend on the length of the options contract and the “moneyness” of the option (basically, how far the strike price and the actual price deviate at the time of purchase).</p>



<p>Why would anyone want to use options? Well, for starters, it allows you to trade with leverage and still manage your risk. The beauty of options trading is that traders can use them when they are extremely confident or extremely uncertain, as options can be used as a hedging measure in combination with other trades. The price of a crypto-asset can go parabolic rather quickly. Options allow you to capture all of the upside (or downside) with only the cost of the premium. You are also protected from the asset going <em>against</em> your thesis to an astronomical amount. At worst, you choose not to exercise the option and the only money you’re out is the sunk premium cost. One key aspect of Hegic that experienced traders will need to consider is that the premium is priced in ETH. As the price of ETH fluctuates, the value of the premium also changes, which will impact your P&amp;L.</p>



<p>To offer a viable trading experience, Hegic requires a deep well of liquidity from which traders can draw. Without sufficient liquidity, traders will be unable to enjoy the same experience provided by centralized exchanges, and liquidity providers will be exposed to even greater counterparty risk when writing contracts. Hegic aims to accomplish this by incentivizing liquidity providers. LPs are called ‘writers’ in the Hegic ecosystem. Writers share the premiums paid in their pools. Hegic also incentivizes liquidity provision with the native HEGIC token. </p>



<p>Wintermute envisions HEGIC to become a governance token for the protocol at some point in the future, but currently the token is only a requirement for purchasing a staking lot. 888,000 HEGIC buys a staking lot and with it, the right to the protocol’s settlement fees. There is one additional incentive available to writers. By providing liquidity, you are credited with writeBTC or writeETH tokens. These tokens can be staked to earn rHegic token, which is essentially a vested version of HEGIC that can be sold at a hefty discount before the vesting period ends in late 2021.</p>



<p>Hegic&nbsp;is one of the more complicated DeFi protocols on the market today. It involves a lot more levers and cranks than discussed here, including a bonding curve that controls the new supply of Hegic. To learn more about Hegic, you can check out <a href="https://hegic.gitbook.io/start/">Hegic&#8217;s documentation</a>. You can also try it out for yourself; All you need is an Ethereum wallet. The protocol does not require KYC or account verification. Hegic is proving to be a worthy rival for Deribit, although they are likely to grow in unison given the unique advantages that each provide. Hopefully, there will be plenty of opportunities for arbitrage between the two platforms headed into the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DeFi projects exist on a spectrum of decentralization. Trustlessness is at the heart of decentralization. But the word ‘trustlessness’ in itself is almost an oxymoron because trust is almost never eliminated from the equation but instead is simply shifted from one counterparty to another. The goal is to minimize the required trust in the pursuit of trustlessness. Even our most trustless examples of smart contracts still require a certain amount of trust that the blockchain infrastructure it is built on will continue to function properly. Additionally, there are internal economic and smart contract security risks in DeFi platforms themselves. Looking beyond that, DeFi platforms face external risks like composability with other protocols and even further out is oracle integrity and off-chain infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adding complexity typically comes with a wider attack surface for smart contracts. Many recent hacks have been caused by oracle manipulation. By simplifying the process of non-custodial asset management, you’re able to limit the attack surface of the average user. This is the guiding principle of DEXTF, permissionless non-custodial oracle-less fund management infrastructure. <a href="http://dextf.com/">DEXTF</a> enables digital-native funds where two parties, the portfolio manager and the investor, which are mutually distrusting of each other can cryptographically verify the status of the funds and enforce their rights directly through a digital wallet.</p>



<h1>What is DEXTF?</h1>



<p>DEXTF is an asset management protocol that allows anyone to create, mint, and redeem XTF funds. At present, DEXTF <a href="https://docs.dextf.com/documentation/faq/supported-tokens">supports 44 different assets</a> and funds are soft-limited to 10 tokens although this limit can be changed. The ticker symbol and asset weights are determined by the fund manager when creating the fund. Each XTF fund is an ERC20 token with its own address and contract allowing users to hold, trade, redeem and utilize XTF fund tokens like any other token.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-300x288.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8694" width="300" height="288" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-300x288.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-1024x985.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-768x738.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-1536x1477.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-2048x1969.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-1568x1508.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<h1>What makes DEXTF unique?</h1>



<p>The DEXTF team spotted a gap in the DeFi ETF space for an easy, accessible way for anyone to create and manage funds in DeFi. They sought to create simple and efficient asset management infrastructure that followed the team’s philosophy that only the bare minimum of logic should be on chain. DEXTF does not rely on oracles. The risk of manipulation present in complex oracle or rebalancing mechanisms tends to result in the use of admin keys in order to respond in a timely manner to attacks or exploits. The DEXTF team is skeptical that any protocol with these mechanisms can truly eliminate the need for these admin keys and subsequently the risk of capture these keys pose to the protocol. With DEXTF, there are no oracles to manipulate that can be used to steal or drain the fund; XTFs can only be minted with or redeemed for their underlying weight of tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DEXTF simply provides a permissionless way to mint new XTF tokens and relies solely on arbitrage and market forces for fund pricing. While only so much logic can be programmed into a smart contract, a community of properly incentivized stakeholders can be the strongest and smartest solution to many problems. Ultimately, reducing ETFs to their simplest form makes XTFs simpler to utilize in a way that is reminiscent of the highly modular design philosophy of UNIX. DEXTF can almost be thought of as a trust-minimized set of building blocks that creates economic incentives and opportunities for the community to be rewarded for taking up each role in the ecosystem.</p>



<h1>How the DEXTF ecosystem functions</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-coin-jigsaw-2@140x140.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8649" width="140" height="140"/></figure></div>



<p>Let’s break down the four roles in the DEXTF ecosystem to understand how they fit together to create highly liquid XTF token funds that are redeemable for their underlying assets. Investors, fund managers, and liquidity providers are eligible to receive ecosystem rewards for participating but we’ll cover that more later on. The team is also planning to add rewards for arbitrageurs.</p>



<h2>Investors</h2>



<p>Those looking to invest in XTF fund tokens can buy existing fund tokens listed on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. Alternatively, you can mint more XTF fund tokens by providing the underlying tokens although this costs more in gas fees. If you do not have them already, you can purchase the required tokens from Kyber right inside the <a href="https://dapp.dextf.com/">DEXTF interface</a> after selecting your desired fund. I recommend taking a look at DEXTF’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nU7ZrFqjWlPT1AYbdx4mYcT84wLy8jmv/view">video tutorials</a> to see how the fund investment process works.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://dapp.dextf.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_450-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8662" width="768" height="432" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_450-1024x576.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_450-300x169.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_450-768x432.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_450.jpg 1333w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></a></figure></div>



<h2>Fund Managers</h2>



<p>The process of creating XTF funds is designed to be simple and self-service. The idea is to promote decentralization by giving anyone the ability to freely and easily <a href="https://dapp.dextf.com/">create funds with idle tokens</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Anyone can create a fund in 4 easy steps:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Click the ‘Create Fund’ button and select your fund’s name and ticker symbol</li><li>Select which assets to include in your fund and the weight of each asset</li><li>Assign a risk rating and add a description to your fund</li><li>Finally, launch your fund on the blockchain</li></ol>



<p>Yet again, I recommend taking a look at DEXTF’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nU7ZrFqjWlPT1AYbdx4mYcT84wLy8jmv/view">video tutorials</a> to see for yourself how it works.</p>



<p>As of this writing, fund managers are currently able to choose from <a href="https://docs.dextf.com/documentation/faq/supported-tokens">44 different assets</a> with a soft limit of 10 assets wrapped around a single XTF token fund (this limit can be changed) but the DEXTF team plans to gradually expand the list of supported assets. You’ll even be able to create a fund consisting of other XTF fund tokens eventually. The DEXTF team also plans to continue adding new features like fund management fees and new asset types including real world assets such as equity, debt, and options.</p>



<h2>Liquidity Providers</h2>



<p>In order for new investors to be able to purchase XTF funds from a DEX, existing XTF fund token holders must provide liquidity. Fund managers and investors can take newly minted XTF tokens and create a pool on Uniswap to earn trading fees and liquidity mining rewards. Liquidity providers are important for ensuring smaller investors can efficiently enter and exit XTF funds while arbitrageurs are able to effectively take advantage of opportunities to drive XTF fund prices in the market.</p>



<h2>Arbitrageurs</h2>



<p>As previously mentioned, DEXTF’s oracle-less design relies on market forces to fairly price XTF funds. When the price of an XTF fund token differs from the value of its underlying assets, it’s up to arbitrageurs to seize the opportunity, balancing out price inefficiencies in the market. For example, an arbitrageur that spots an XTF token that is overvalued on Uniswap can provide the underlying tokens to mint and sell new XTF tokens. This action rewards the arbitrageur with profit for keeping the XTF fund properly priced and also pays trading fees to the pool’s liquidity providers. Arbitrageurs are vital to the DEXTF ecosystem because they indirectly provide price information to the protocol through their actions which eliminates the need for the oracle. To reward their participation, DEXTF is planning to provide ecosystem rewards to arbitrageurs soon.</p>



<h1>DEXTF Governance Token and Ecosystem Rewards</h1>



<p>DEXTF is an ERC20 token created to govern the DEXTF protocol. DEXTF tokens can be used to vote on proposals for potential protocol changes including the adjustment of system parameters like management fee factors or interest rate algorithms. DEXTF holders may also delegate their voting power to another address or delegate who may propose, vote on, and execute proposals on their behalf.</p>



<p>Additionally, the distribution of DEXTF tokens has been designed to reward network participants for performance, liquidity, volume and other interesting metrics in an effort to increase adoption of the DEXTF Dapp and XTF token funds.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hVAdkELzRHVejxtxsGI9rRL0GfjKZbQq9IA2jpw2sV-1fR-7CyNr4OdJ7ODtftRPn4QBzRHmTdkhqIQ2UuIunExFcexO9S9p4tzIPIINxjDDcQ1zaDEaO2KpbBsYUsD0hme14Grc" width="624" height="348"></p>



<h2>DEXTF Rewards</h2>



<p>DEXTF Rewards fall into three categories: Monthly Incentive Program (for Fund Managers and Investors), Milestone-based Incentive Program (for Fund Managers) and Liquidity Mining Incentive Program (for any user). These rewards are to be distributed over a 5 year period to encourage long-term adoption.<br><br>Users are eligible to receive DEXTF rewards for performing the following actions:</p>



<h3>Launch a new XTF fund token&nbsp;</h3>



<p>You can receive DEXTF tokens for launching new XTF fund tokens by selecting the underlying assets and relative weights. 17,000,000 DEXTF tokens or 17% of the total supply is reserved for monthly incentives for being one of the top funds, top new funds, and top performing new funds.</p>



<p>5,000,000 DEXTF or 5% of the total supply is set aside for Milestone Incentives, more specifically for the first funds to cross certain milestones. Learn more details about <a href="https://medium.com/dextf/intro-to-dextf-tokenomics-and-governance-aa0b620d959d">DEXTF incentives</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that when you take your idle tokens and launch your own fund, you’re competing to win a ratio of DEXTF rewards relative to the total. You can find the list of supported tokens <a href="https://docs.dextf.com/documentation/faq/supported-tokens">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Minting of XTF fund tokens</h3>



<p>You can receive DEXTF tokens for either minting XTF fund tokens via in kind contribution of the underlyings or through KyberSwap (except for tokens that are currently not supported by Kyber itself in which case a link to Paraswap will be provided to secure the missing tokens). 3,000,000 DEXTF or 3% of the total supply is set aside for Investors’ Monthly Incentives. The top 20 investors are eligible to receive a share of these rewards each month.</p>



<h3>Liquidity Mining</h3>



<p>You can receive DEXTF tokens for providing liquidity to the whitelisted Uniswap pools with XTF pairings. Out of the total  25,000,000 of all DEXTF tokens reserved for liquidity miners, 30% of it are reserved for the DEXTF/ETH pool LPs while the remaining 70% or 17,500,000 DEXTF are distributed across all other pools proportionally to the size of each pool in USDT terms. You can contact the DEXTF team at <a href="mailto:request@dextf.com">requests@dextf.com</a> to request a pool be whitelisted.</p>



<h3>Distribution Schedule</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="140" height="140" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-hourglass-coins@140x140.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8653"/></figure></div>



<p>Monthly Incentive Program rewards are streamed daily to a unique smart contract, starting from the end of term plus 1 day. Terms start on 15th of the month and ends on the 14th of following month. DEXTF liquidity mining rewards are streamed every block. Reward tokens are claimable in full only after 30 days. Liquidity providers receive a 10% bonus reward in DEXTF for staying for the full term.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say you started providing liquidity on November 15th and continued to do so for one month (so until December 14th), then you would only fully receive the rewards for that month of providing liquidity until January 15th, 2021.</p>

<h1>What’s next for DEXTF?</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="140" height="140" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-saving-increase-2@140x140.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8651"/></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/dextf/what-are-structured-tokens-introducing-dexsts-b87474cba078">Decentralized Structured Tokens</a> (DEXSTs) are hybrid tokens with adjustable risk-return profiles, better suited to express non-linear market views. DEXSTs can utilize yield generating assets, derivatives, synthetics, and options from many different DeFi projects. Incorporating these sophisticated assets allows DEXSTs to take advantage of more opportunities in the market and allows their creators to adjust the risk-return profile to cater to a variety of market views.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Capital Protected Structured Token (CPST)</h2>



<p>The first Decentralized Structured Token (DEXST) is a <a href="https://medium.com/dextf/what-are-structured-tokens-introducing-dexsts-b87474cba078">Capital Protected Structured Token (CPST)</a> for ETH.&nbsp; As the name implies, Capital Protected Structured Tokens attempt to protect you from potential downside to your capital, ETH in this case, while maintaining exposure to the potential upside. CPSTs can be designed to be anti-fragile, suitable for any market conditions potentially performing best when the market is volatile in a range-bound market.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"> <img loading="lazy" width="140" height="140" class="wp-image-8660" style="width: 140px;" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-bear-market-1@140x140.png" alt=""><img loading="lazy" width="140" height="140" class="wp-image-8659" style="width: 140px;" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-bull-market-1@140x140.png" alt=""></p>



<p>The first iteration of CPST was launched in late September 2020. In the time since, the DEXTF team has worked with Opyn and UMA to incorporate feedback from the first iteration to co-build the next iteration of the primitive which could generate sustainable liquidity making it attractive to buyers. New CPSTs will be using UMA’s Zero-Coupon Bonds, a longer maturity version of the yield dollar, and a longer maturity Opyn call option with June 2021 expiry. The idea is to create a floor value of sorts for the underlying ETH but still allow investors to participate in any upside. So if you’re bullish but don’t want to remain fully exposed, CPSTs offer an efficient way to invest.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>The DEXTF team has built simple yet sophisticated fund management infrastructure that anyone can take advantage of to manage their portfolio. The permissionless and oracle-less design of DEXTF makes it highly scalable and resistant to capture or manipulation. DEXTF is also working in partnership with many prominent members of the DeFi community such as Opyn, UMA, Kyber, Ren Alliance, Set Protocol, and so many more to expand their already flexible set of components. All the necessary components and incentives are there for any community member to build or participate in an efficient ecosystem around digital-native funds and be rewarded for doing so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DeFi has been on fire lately. Following the space has been absolutely riveting. We&#8217;ve got another sneak peek of an interesting DeFi protocol for you today. The folks over at MCDEX have taken decentralized perpetual contracts and combined them with a hybrid on-chain AMM/off-chain order book in their recent upgrade MCDEX V2. </p>



<p><strong>MCDEX&#8217;s first decentralized perpetual contract ETH-PERP launching Monday June 29th, 2020</strong> makes full use of this hybrid model to enable users to <a href="https://mcdex.io/trade?invite_code=052t01">trade ETH/USD perpetual contracts with up to 10x leverage</a> and no expiration. Additionally, MCDEX has recently proposed a new AMM price formula which enables lower slippage, better capital efficiency, and near 0 impermanent loss for liquidity providers.</p>



<h2>What is MCDEX?</h2>



<p>Before we dive into the tech, I think it is useful to understand what inspired MCDEX. The team that built MCDEX is a team from China formerly involved in PoW mining. They saw the potential in DeFi and decided to build products that make investing in DeFi easier to continue contributing to the ecosystem as the industry transitions to ETH2.0. Personally, I think the team&#8217;s foresight is readily apparent in many of their designs. So without further ado, let&#8217;s dive into it.</p>



<p><a href="https://mcdex.io/trade?invite_code=052t01">MCDEX</a> is a decentralized derivatives exchange for traders to long/short efficiently and securely. MCDEX is built on the Mai Protocol V2. Fun fact: the name Mai is actually a pun made with the pinyin for two Chinese characters măi &#8220;买&#8221; meaning buy and mài &#8220;卖&#8221; meaning sell.&nbsp;Funny enough, that&#8217;s exactly what the Mai Protocol does: reduce the complexity of trading decentralized perpetual contracts down to just buy or sell. Historically, decentralized derivatives required many steps; MCDEX eliminates the extra step, streamlining the process and making it more approachable to new users. Additionally, security audits for MCDEX’s Mai Protocol V2 and perpetual contracts have been completed by OpenZeppelin and ConSensys Diligence.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="728" height="376" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mai2-arch.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8313" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mai2-arch.png 728w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/06/mai2-arch-300x155.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /><figcaption>hybrid architecture of Mai Protocol V2</figcaption></figure>



<p>As previously mentioned, what makes MCDEX unique is its combination of perpetual contracts with an off-chain order book / on-chain AMM hybrid. This hybrid model gives traders the best of both worlds. The off-chain order book provides traders with the look and feel of a centralized exchange while the AMM provides reliable on-chain liquidity. </p>



<p>There&#8217;s a sort of symbiosis between the two; the order book offers efficient liquidity but tends to be a bit more centralized whereas the AMM&#8217;s liquidity is always available to both traders and other smart contracts on-chain. This opens up a world of possibilities for these perpetual contracts to be used in the wider DeFi ecosystem.</p>



<p>Introducing the AMM to MCDEX not only provided reliable on-chain liquidity, it also enabled a key feature of perpetual contracts: funding rate. In a nutshell, the funding rate&#8217;s purpose is to balance out long or short orders in times of high demand to maintain an accurate index price. So naturally, the funding rate is dynamically adjusted by the protocol in response market demand.  For example, when the funding rate is positive it means long position holders pay to fund short positions (short position holders). This incentivizes users to take up the short side of the trade effectively balancing demand for both sides.</p>



<p>This is where the AMM and off-chain order book work so nicely together. The funding rate needs to be derived on-chain to be sufficiently decentralized but on-chain trading isn&#8217;t always ideal for traders. Liquidity and trading activity will naturally gravitate towards the efficiency of the off-chain order book, but arbitrage opportunities between the order book and AMM improve the AMM&#8217;s liquidity and earn more fees for liquidity providers. Not to mention, many of you will be happy to hear ETH-PERP takes advantage of Chainlink&#8217;s ETH/USD Price Reference Contract live on the Ethereum mainnet as its index price feed.</p>



<h2>Trade ETH-PERP with up to 10x leverage</h2>



<p>MCDEX is set to launch ETH-PERP trading on Monday June 29, 2020. Get a <a href="https://mcdex.io/trade?invite_code=052t01">sneak peek</a> at the interface today.</p>



<p>MCDEX&#8217;s trading interface was designed to be intuitive with a familiar look and feel for experienced traders yet simple enough for new users. I liked how all the info I needed was laid out in the interface; I found the Etherscan links for contract and asset addresses particularly helpful.</p>



<p>Traders will appreciate the performance of MCDEX&#8217;s order book interface. With its speed, efficiency, and support for features like limit orders you might find yourself surprised you aren&#8217;t trading on a centralized exchange.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><a href="https://mcdex.io/trade?invite_code=052t01"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="613" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo_2020-06-26_10-02-39-1024x613.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8337" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo_2020-06-26_10-02-39-1024x613.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo_2020-06-26_10-02-39-300x180.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo_2020-06-26_10-02-39-768x460.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/06/photo_2020-06-26_10-02-39.jpg 1270w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a><figcaption>Order book trading interface</figcaption></figure></div>

<p></p>



<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with other popular perpetual contract exchanges like BitMEX, it&#8217;ll take no time at all to get settled in. Head over to <a href="https://mcdex.io/trade?invite_code=052t01">MCDEX</a> and explore it for yourself. </p>



<h2>Looking towards the future</h2>



<p>Many aspects of MCDEX&#8217;s design illustrate the team&#8217;s willingness to learn from battle-tested concepts in DeFi and desire to contribute the ecosystem&#8217;s long-term success. Take for example, 1% out of the 2.5% liquidation penalty automatically goes to an insurance fund. You can find more info about MCDEX&#8217;s roadmap in<a href="https://mcdex.io/references/#/en/white-paper"> the whitepaper</a>.</p>



<h3>Structured funds enable new strategies for even inexperienced DeFi users</h3>



<p>Trading perpetual contracts isn&#8217;t everyone&#8217;s cup of tea but that doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t be able to get in on the action. While perpetual contracts are MCDEX&#8217;s first product, the team plans to release structured trading funds for various risk preferences. This creates the opportunity for even inexperienced traders to take part in perpetual contract trading.</p>



<p>Structured funds on MCDEX will allow anyone to deposit assets and automatically trade perpetual contracts with a robotic or human-managed fund strategy. This creates the opportunity for MCDEX users to expose themselves to many different strategies and potentially maximize their profits. Not to mention, fundholders will be eligible for liquidity mining incentives&#8230;</p>



<h3>MCB token and Liquidity Mining</h3>



<p>MCDEX plans to launch a native token (tentatively in Q3 2020) called MCB token to align its stakeholders, a portion of which will be distributed through liquidity mining to incentivize users to invest in funds. Once launched, MCB tokens will be distributed to the funds based on their net asset value at a fixed amount per day. This should effectively incentivize users to invest in the funds that perform the best whether they be a social or automated funds. Put simply, the better a fund performs, the faster its net asset value grows, the more MCB tokens fundholders are rewarded. Social fund managers will even receive a cut of the MCB they earn for fundholders.</p>



<p><strong>Initial distribution of MCB tokens</strong></p>



<ol><li>25% to founding team and early investors</li><li>25% to MCDEX Foundation for token sale to cover expenses such as development, audits, market makers, marketing, etc. </li><li>50% to user incentives with a limit up to 5% per year.</li></ol>



<p>That limit of 5% a year stuck out to me as something interested because it means that user incentives are planned for a minimum of 10 years. This fits well into MCDEX&#8217;s roadmap to add more user incentives and eventually enable on-chain governance run by MCB token holders. </p>



<p><strong>Trading competition</strong></p>



<p>To celebrate the launch of their ETH-PERP smart contract, MCDEX is holding a trading competition with prizes up to $2500 + 2500MCB. The competition will begin on June 29th, 2020 from 12:00 pm UTC, and will close on July 13, 2020, at 12:00 pm UTC. More details can be found <a href="https://mcdex.io/competition">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Concluding thoughts</h3>



<p>Ultimately, I find it very encouraging how MCDEX seems to understand the necessity of balancing ease of use, efficiency, decentralization and sustainability when designing smart contract systems. On a personal note, I enjoyed poking through Mai Protocol V2 to write this article because it reminds me again how we&#8217;re truly on the cutting edge here in DeFi.</p>



<p><strong>We highly recommend you check out MCDEX and see for yourself how the order book enables a smooth and efficient trading experience. Stay tuned for more details regarding MCB liquidity mining.</strong> In the mean time, click here to <a href="https://mcdex.io/trade?invite_code=052t01">head over to MCDEX and get started trading perpetual contracts</a> today.</p>

<p><em><strong>TLDR: </strong><a href="https://docs.dex.ag/proxy-contract">Integrating DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster with custom fees</a> into your platform provides your users or smart contract with convenient native liquidity while allowing you to build a sustainable business model.</em></p>



<h2>Liquidity is vital for the growth of DeFi</h2>



<p>Users want to experience all DeFi has to offer. But often times to do that you  need to swap between tokens or stablecoins. Liquidity is an important resource that enables DeFi&#8217;s composability and makes it possible for many DApps to function. It&#8217;s the blood that flows through the veins of DeFi. </p>



<p>For a smooth user experience, it&#8217;s essential to have a reliable liquidity at a decent price. DEXes are an obvious choice for reliable liquidity when designing an application or smart contract. However, relying on a single DEX comes with its disadvantages. For example, maybe the token your users want to trade isn&#8217;t listed or has extremely low liquidity causing costly price slippage. </p>



<h3>DeFi is all about having options</h3>



<p>If one DEX isn&#8217;t ideal, The obvious answer is to do what DeFi does best with money legos and combine the awesome powers of DEXes. That&#8217;s why we built our other service DEX.AG, a DEX aggregator.

<p><strong><em>Alex Miles, co-founder of TokenTax, discusses his quest to ease the crypto community&#8217;s DeFi tax woes.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I first heard about bitcoin while i was in university around 2010, but didn’t mine or purchase any (fml). I bought my first half bitcoin in 2013. Fast forward to 2017, I started trading and casually buying/selling alt coins, I realized that calculating taxes on my activity would be very complicated. </p>



<p>Over the course of a month in 2017, I built a simple demo application that linked your coinbase account and calculated your cost basis data. The application then generated a filled out 8949. I showed it to a few friends and they were really happy with the experience. I submitted what I built to the 2017 Product Hunt Global Hackathon and ended up winning the grand prize! </p>



<p>After that, I partnered with my co-founder Zac McClure who has a background in finance, accounting, and impact investing. Together we formed a plan to take TokenTax to the next level. A lot of our initial plan is now built and we plan to continue to grow the business.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>We are building the easiest way for cryptocurrency users to calculate and file their crypto taxes. At TokenTax we are intensely focused on building the best tax experience for DeFi. We believe DeFi has the potential to bring mainstream adoption to cryptocurrency and we want to do everything in our power to help make this a reality.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>Any cryptocurrency or DeFi user! We are an international crypto tax calculator so we support any country, not just the US.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>I’m excited to continue to build out our DeFi tax tools. These are open to the public and can be used to download your transaction history for popular DeFi apps like Uniswap or compound. Every popular DeFi app in in the works like dYdX, Chai, and Maker to name a few <br>&#8211; <a href="https://tokentax.co/compound-finance">https://tokentax.co/compound-finance</a> <br>&#8211; <a href="https://tokentax.co/uniswap">https://tokentax.co/uniswap </a></p>



<p>We also have built a wonderful knowledge base of guides and help articles. We are working full time to build our more helpful resources:<br>&#8211; <a href="https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/">https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/</a></p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>We plan on being the tax and reporting backbone behind DeFi. We want to help legitimize DeFi in the eyes of our government authorities around the world by providing users with excellent documentation.</p>



<h3>What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>Honestly, I think one of the best things the DeFi community has, is the people within the community. There’s so much creativity and passion being shared online and I think this helps fuel a ton of innovation. I think we often forget we’re all on the same team. We should try to fight less about small topics that don’t matter. We need to remember who we are fighting against.</p>



<h3>How can readers learn more about your product/service?</h3>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Margin trading is extremely popular in the cryptocurrency markets. In the past, traders used to rely on centralized exchanges to trade using leverage. But recently, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-dapp/">DApps</a> that provide this kind of trading have become some of the most popular services in <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi/">DeFi</a>.</p>
<h1>What is margin trading?</h1>
<p>Margin trading is a method of trading using borrowed funds allowing you further leverage your existing assets. <strong>Margin trading comes with higher risks than normal trading.</strong> Because while it does offer the potential to amplify your gains, it can also amplify losses incurred through trading. In traditional finance, brokers typically provide the funds necessary to open a leveraged position. In DeFi, margin traders borrow cryptocurrencies from decentralized lending protocols powered by smart contracts. Lenders<a href="https://defipulse.com/income"> earn interest rates anywhere from 5-20%</a> for lending their tokens to borrowers like margin traders.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>When you open a margin trade, you select your desired amount of leverage and lock in funds (sometimes referred to as collateral) worth a portion of your total order, also known as your margin. Leverage in this case refers to ratio of borrowed assets to the value of your margin. For example, if you opened a margin trade with 3x leverage worth $3,000, you&#8217;d be required to lock in $1,000 worth of collateral.</p>
<p>Margin trading positions can either by long or short. Opening a long position means you believe that the price will go up. Whereas, opening a short position, also known as shorting, means you believe the price of the asset your trading will go down.</p>
<p>To new traders with little collateral, margin trading can be very appealing because it gives you access to more capital. However, you should be aware that trading with leverage multiplies your profits <em>and your losses</em>, meaning that <strong>you should never risk more than you&#8217;re willing to lose</strong>. If the value of your margin falls or the price does not go the way you predicted and your trade becomes over-leveraged, your margin trade can be liquidated and your collateral can be sold to repay the assets you borrowed plus interest.</p>
<h1>Top Margin Trading Platforms in DeFi</h1>
<p>DeFi margin trading platforms are built using smart contracts which enforce trading rules and facilitate the loans between lenders and borrowers, or rather margin traders in this case. When you margin trading cryptocurrency on any of these platforms, you will pay interest on any assets that you borrow. Potential leverage and borrowing interest rates vary from platform to platform. And, the interest you pay is subject to fluctuation depending on the platform&#8217;s available supply and demand for loans.</p>
