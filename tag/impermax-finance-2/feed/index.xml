<p>Previously, providing liquidity to automated market maker (AMM) projects in DeFi has been a manual and somewhat tedious process. You source the required amount of tokens for your desired pair, approve token contracts, pay gas fees to deposit, and then if you’re looking to farm further yields you might go and stake your new liquidity provider (LP) tokens, which takes yet another transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You go through all these steps only to endure the risk of impermanent loss (IL) while you serve as an LP. Now, though, <em>it is</em> possible to provide liquidity and earn DeFi yields simply and without the risk of IL. That’s because <a href="https://impermax.finance/"><strong>Impermax</strong></a>, a decentralized marketplace for borrowing and lending LP tokens, is offering a game-changing new way to participate in LPing called <em>Indirect Liquidity Providing</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uqVZj40ev81y7CVPscU_0BVsVbfsJJdOBw4VjUjsn0FlIU629FU_0Xnxwji7vd5dEYl2qaZZDIR_l1n-QHD0xv5zWwFbETl4airftBWwWfbQF-iVk3VMoZFQHmnrTNA_r6ThM_Ui" alt=""/></figure>



<h2><strong>A new way to LP in DeFi</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Indirect Liquidity Providing</strong>, a novel way to participate in DeFi liquidity markets, involves earning yield by <em>lending </em>assets to other LP token holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="http://defipulse.com/impermax">Impermax</a> system this works through the protocol’s lending pools, which use LP tokens like ETH-DAI Uniswap V2 LP tokens as collateral. These pools only allow borrowing and lending around a given pool’s token pair, such as ETH and/or DAI if you’re borrowing against ETH-DAI UNI-V2 tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accordingly, DeFi users can now supply a <em>single </em>token to an Impermax lending pool to earn yields indirectly through an AMM, all while facing essentially no threat of impermanent loss. This is in stark contrast to the IL risk users take on when they directly serve as LPs!&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://impermax.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="555" height="329" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2z3yCV7xfTT6sA_rTwCtmQN47qNPcMAicueZTYMiZ9_DZP4SQEghbdR73-3fxZvHPL7D7fsnXJdHC6-v0Kx8kU2EKtvRsAkit5QQp6aO0JtDS4YkjtZBE23z9RhMDhPy2KOzLGHc"></a></p>



<p>In this way, we can understand Impermax as an <strong>Indirect Liquidity market</strong>. Users lend their assets to yield farmers, who then convert these assets into further LP tokens in order to boost their own yields. These yield farmers take on all the risk of impermanent loss while paying out a portion of their yields to pay back their loans from Impermax lenders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Yield farming made simple</strong></h2>



<p>A key advantage of the Indirect Liquidity Providing system is that it offers lenders an easy, simplistic avenue for yield farming. This is because Impermax’s lending markets do away with having to go through multiple steps like acquiring LP tokens and thereafter staking them in order to farm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, <strong>lending through Impermax offers a casual, one-step, staking-like process for yield farming</strong>: you deposit a token into your lending pool of choice, and voila, you’re earning yield and can claim it any time. That’s about as simple as it gets when it comes to farming opportunities in DeFi, so these farms also minimize the need for transactions, which can really add up gas-wise with other traditional yield farms!&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi beginners want entry-level yield farms, and DeFi veterans enjoy simple passive earning opportunities, so Indirect Liquidity Providing has a little something for everyone. This will ensure Impermax will continue to have an important role to play in DeFi, as there’s big demand for simple yield farming solutions while many AMMs are becoming increasingly complex, like Uniswap V3.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Good for DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>To compete with traditional finance, DeFi will need to continue being a liquidity blackhole and continue attracting in more money. More money equals more efficiency, and more efficiency means better options for users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, <strong>Impermax’s Indirect Liquidity Providing innovation represents a benefit for all of DeFi</strong>, insofar as this new lending style makes it easier to provide liquidity to AMMs and can thus help these AMMs grow faster than they would have otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In time, then, we might even see some AMM projects incentivize and promote Impermax’s lending markets since these markets can serve as a direct and increasingly important pipeline of activity to them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Learn more about Impermax</strong></h2>



<p>Impermax is a first-of-its-kind protocol for borrowing and lending LP tokens, so be sure to keep the project on your radar as it now works on adding support for LP tokens from Uniswap V3 and other major DeFi trading protocols like Curve and SushiSwap. You can learn more by following Impermax on <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpermaxFinance">Twitter</a> or by joining in on the project’s community discussions on <a href="https://discord.gg/XN739EgG4X">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ImpermaxFinance">Telegram</a>.</p>

<p>Being a liquidity provider in DeFi has typically been associated with opportunity costs and risks, particularly the always dreaded risk of impermanent loss. As a liquidity provider, it is important to familiarize yourself with the concept of impermanent loss and determining when the risk to reward ratio is right. But the truth is you have options aside from accepting impermanent loss as an inevitability, you could explore what’s possible with <a href="https://impermax.finance/">Impermax</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Impermax set out to build what they refer to as the “missing piece of the AMM puzzle,” a protocol which allows users to maximize their AMM liquidity pool (LP) tokens. With Impermax, anyone can create a lending market for Uniswap (and soon to be other) AMM LP pairs. Liquidity providers can utilize their LP tokens as collateral to borrow tokens or leverage/multiply their AMM LP positions. Impermax allows users to put LP tokens to work which were once idle leading to more complex strategies and potentially ecosystem growth spurred by increased productivity.</p>



<h2>Maximize the productivity of your AMM LP tokens</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><a href="https://impermax.finance/"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/impermax-blog-thumb-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9190" width="300" height="300"/></a></figure></div>



<p>As previously mentioned, Impermax is <a href="https://impermax.finance/a-lending-market-designed-for-the-lp-tokens-of-uniswap-and-other-amms/">a lending market designed for liquidity pool tokens</a> of Uniswap and other AMMs. Let’s examine how this works behind the scenes. As a borrower, you must first deposit your LP tokens to use as collateral before being able to borrow or leverage. Impermax takes the LP tokens provided as collateral and allows users to borrow the underlying tokens in the LP pair. Interestingly, lenders can choose to lend one or both of the tokens in a LP pair to earn interest without any exposure to impermanent loss. Impermax refers to this as lndirect Liquidity Providing because lenders are basically earning a percentage of the trading fees that borrowers earn but without any impermanent loss.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that lending pools are isolated to each LP token pair and loans are 100% backed by the tokens inside the LP token pair held as collateral. The Time-Weighted Average Price or TWAP provided by Uniswap is used to calculate the liquidation prices of loans to ensure loans remain 100% collateralized. This is kind of cool because it enables Impermax users to permissionlessly add new Uniswap LP tokens and start a lending market for any LP token pair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Borrowers can choose to borrow either token in the pair individually for a unique strategy or simply borrow both to obtain leverage for their desired LP position. Impermax provides an easy to use interface which simplifies the process of leveraging LP tokens up to 10x to a single transaction. Impermax has a liquidity mining program which rewards users with <a href="https://impermax.medium.com/impermax-tokenomics-34cb3dd66474">IMX tokens</a> for borrowing select token pairs. Since your rewards are based off of borrowing, you can actually multiply your liquidity mining rewards by leveraging select token pairs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/borrowable-collateral-infographic.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9191" width="340" height="312"/></figure></div>



<h2>Use caution when operating power tools</h2>



<p>As with all things in DeFi, nothing is without risk. We’ll be discussing some here but as always we encourage you to do your own research. Luckily, Impermax has a very nice <a href="https://app.impermax.finance/risks">risks section </a>to aid you in your due diligence. Like most lending markets in DeFi, it’s possible that you may temporarily be unable to withdraw tokens as a lender if the lending pool has insufficient liquidity like in the event of a “bank run.” Although it should be noted that the dynamic interest rates are designed to alleviate these issues eventually. And of course, if you borrow or leverage, you face the potential risk of liquidation if you don’t meet collateral requirements.</p>



<p>You should also be aware that the permissionless nature of Impermax lending pools is a double-edged sword that carries unique risks. Since anyone can add a new AMM LP token pair and create a lending market, anyone can add new pairs even if they have low liquidity or are potentially malicious. Luckily, these risks are isolated to individual AMM LP token pairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, Impermax relies on Time Weighted Average Prices from the AMM. This means that if a pair is inactive for a long period of time, the price of the oracle may differ substantially from the market price. Additionally, an inactive pair may not attract enough liquidators to insure loans are liquidated in time which can result in a possible loss for lenders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>You can never quite tell which direction the DeFi community will run with an idea but the writing is on the wall that liquidity providers want more out of their LP tokens. Impermax has designed their product to cater to the needs of these liquidity providers in a permissionless way similar to the AMMs themselves. This is enabled by Impermax’s practical and prudent decision to isolate risk to individual lending pools. Builders don’t have to ask for permission to whitelist their project’s AMM LP pair and can even permissionlessly incorporate Impermax lending pools at a protocol level.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a borrower looking to leverage your LP tokens or a lender looking to earn some extra yield from indirect liquidity proving, you should explore <a href="https://impermax.finance/">Impermax</a> available lending pools today. If you’re unsure or just want to take a test drive, you can test Impermax’s application at no cost on Ropsten testnet with zero risks.
