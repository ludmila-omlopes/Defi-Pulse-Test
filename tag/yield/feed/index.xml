										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alpha Homora was a DeFi product born out of practicality. Those familiar with DeFi can tell you that users will go to extraordinary lengths when they spot an opportunity. This proved to be especially true as the yield farming craze reached a fever pitch in 2020 when users would combine various lending protocols to leverage yield farming opportunities. It wasn’t long before <a href="https://alphafinance.io/">Alpha Finance Lab</a> spotted this gap in the market and created Alpha Homora to give users a better way to yield farm with leverage more efficiently while also attempting to minimize the risks involved.</p>



<p>Alpha Homora V2 builds on the popular Alpha Homora V1 yield farming product, supporting more AMM protocols, including Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap, allowing yield farmers to borrow various assets in addition to ETH, and enabling leverage of up to 9x leverage thanks to new partnerships.<strong> </strong><a href="https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/"><strong>Alpha Homora V2</strong></a><strong> is set to launch on Feb 1st.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-1024x549.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8843" width="768" height="412" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-1024x549.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-300x161.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-768x411.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<h2>How does leveraged yield farming work?</h2>



<p>Manually yield farming with leverage required you to take out and manage loans across several lending platforms in what amounted to a nerve-wrecking position that could be extremely hard to ‘unwind’. Using <a href="https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/">Alpha Homora V2</a> is a lot simpler and helps minimize the risks involved (though <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/risk">nothing is risk-free</a>). First, you select a supported liquidity pool from popular exchanges like SushiSwap, Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve that are on Alpha Homora v2 and then supply either or both of the tokens to your desired pool. For example, if you choose the SushiSwap&#8217;s ETH/USDC pool that is on Alpha Homora V2 you can provide ETH, USDC, or both. Note, you don’t need to have equal value of both tokens in order to yield farm with Alpha Homora V2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, you’ll decide whether or not you want to use leverage (which goes up to 9x for selected pools). And then, follow the prompts to confirm and submit your transaction and <em>viola </em>Alpha Homora automagically handles the rest. Users can borrow multiple assets, re-leverage, and deleverage their positions easily in just a few clicks. Compared to doing this process by hand, Alpha Homora can <em>feel like magic.</em> It’s easy to see where the name comes from.</p>



<h1>What’s new in Alpha Homora V2?</h1>



<p>Strong partnerships have shaped the design of Alpha Homora V2. Many of you may have noticed that V2 allows yield farmers to take advantage of significantly more leverage than its predecessor. Behind the scenes, Alpha Homora V2 utilizes CREAM V2’s liquidity to take on leverage for its users. Sometimes referred to as The Iron Bank, CREAM V2 allows whitelisted partner protocols like Alpha Homora V2 to take out loans with less collateral requirements. This results in more leverage for Alpha Homora’s yield farmers and higher interest rates for CREAM V2 users.<br></p>



<p>Alpha Finance Labs worked closely with its partners to enable leveraged yield farming of liquidity pools on Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap. And in an effort to help strengthen its partners’ communities, Alpha Homora V2 will not automatically sell and reinvest the farmed tokens. <strong>At launch, Alpha Homora V2 will feature the following leveraged farming pools:</strong></p>



<p><strong>New leveraged pools:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Curve’s 3pool (USDT, USDC, DAI)</li><li>Balancer’s PERP/USDC</li></ul>



<p><strong>Pools migrated from V1:</strong></p>



<ul><li>SushiSwap’s ETH/SUSHI</li><li>Uniswap’s ETH/UNI</li></ul>



<p>In a nutshell, farmers will be able to leverage USDT, USDC, DAI, and ETH to farm CRV, PERP, or SUSHI tokens with up to 9x leverage. On the flipside, lenders will be able to lend ETH, USDT, USDC, and DAI on day one to start earning interest. The plan is to continue to add even more new pools and migrate more pools from V1 over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those curious, be sure to check out these fantastic posts written by the Alpha Finance team that walks you through Alpha Homora V2 from the perspective of <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-in-yield-farmers-perspectives/">yield farmers</a> and <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-in-lenders-perspectives/">lenders</a>. Alpha Homora is also offering additional yield in the form of ALPHA rewards for both farmers. See <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/liquidity-mining-part-2a">here</a> for more information.</p>



<h2>Migrating to V2</h2>



<p>To ensure a smooth transition, ALPHA rewards will continue for a limited time for those liquidity mining on Alpha Homora V1. Although farmers should be aware that leveraged positions on Alpha Homora v2 will get more rewards compared to those on V1. This creates an incentive to migrate sooner rather than later. Here’s <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/72-hour-countdown/">a step-by-step guide</a> for those looking to migrate.</p>



<h2>What is ibETHv2?</h2>



<p>When you lend out an asset on Alpha Homora, you receive the corresponding ibToken or interest bearing token. ibETHv2 is an interest-bearing ETH token you receive when lending ETH to Alpha Homora V2. Alpha Homora typically has competitive yields for ETH due to the high demand from its leverage yield farming pools. Alpha Finance Lab also runs a <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/trading-volume-mining-part-2b">Trading Volume Mining</a> program which rewards users for supplying liquidity to ibETH/ALPHA and ibETHv2/ALPHA pools.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/o7JpNF2vwiZxUlXbPbEtUtMMlbqUwQM-KpKE5OSCqCYH0jEBrzXPKlkjlCp1E7fk5JD8rQx5sGaQqQaShoaL1BF8_FuqNWS_yV7z5qzmfbBNjFw_L6otv5Yzlfeo2yw2RYBZgEsm" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The ibETHv2/ALPHA pool on SushiSwap <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/72-hour-countdown/">goes live on Feb 3rd</a>. Liquidity providers of this pool will receive ALPHA rewards as well as SUSHI tokens from SushiSwap’s Onsen program. Rewards from Alpha Finance’s Trading Volume Mining program will be reflected in the form of trading fees APY when you remove liquidity (not airdropped to your wallet). Those providing liquidity to the ibETH/ALPHA pool on Uniswap will still receive rewards until Feb 3rd, 1pm UTC.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>Alpha Finance Lab’s initial release of Alpha Homora was well-received by the DeFi community given the immediate utility it provided to yield farmers. Alpha Homora V2 built on this popular platform to provide more utility for its users and value for its partner protocols. Key partnerships like the utilization of CREAM V2’s Iron Bank will allow Alpha Homora V2’s users to achieve higher levels of capital efficiency. It’s undeniable we’ve entered a new era in DeFi where partnerships can give you an edge more now than ever. So it will be very interesting to see how such a deep protocol level partnership influences the future growth of both platforms. Regardless of how things pan out, Alpha Homora V2 users will reap the benefits in the meantime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many would argue that generating yield with stablecoins is currently one of DeFi’s biggest use cases. So it’s no wonder we’ve seen a flurry of different stablecoins, yield aggregators and vaults entering the market, each with their own tokenized representation of yield-bearing stablecoins. You can almost picture these yield-bearing tokens like snowflakes; each similar at a glance but entirely unique when examined closely. When snowflakes are combined they become an indistinguishable mass that can be shaped to create something more like a snowman or igloo. Whether you prefer to look at protocols and tokens like snowflakes or money legos, there are undeniable benefits to combining and layering different DeFi protocols to create something new. This is precisely the logic behind <a href="https://snowswap.org/">SnowSwap</a> which aims to be the defacto way to swap yield-bearing assets like stablecoins, tokenized BTC, ETH2 staking tokens and other similar assets.</p>



<h2>What is SnowSwap?</h2>



<p>Imagine you have USDC deposited into yEarn’s yUSDC vault but you notice you could be earning a higher yield using yDAI. You could pay the gas required for all the transactions to withdraw your USDC, convert it to DAI, and then re-deposit your DAI into Yearn or you could save yourself the hassle and use SnowSwap. <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/snowswap-bringing-liquidity-to-stablecoin-yield-farming-12e222af0462">SnowSwap</a>, based on Curve’s AMM model, allows users to easily enter and exit yVaults and other yield bearing tokens for only the cost of a swap fee. Increasing liquidity for similar yield-bearing tokens makes it easier for users to speculate on their yield or performance. SnowSwap’s first pools, <a href="https://snowswap.org/iearn/">yVault USD</a> (yDAI, yUSDC, yUSDT, yTUSD) and <a href="https://snowswap.org/busd/">yVault Curve</a> (yUSD, ybCRV), were focused on yield-bearing stablecoin tokens. It didn’t stop at stablecoins though; the <a href="https://snowswap.org/pusd/">btcSNOW pool</a> (YcrvRenWSBTC, FcrvRenWBTC) features yield-bearing tokenized versions of BTC from yEarn and Harvest Finance.</p>



<p>The next step in SnowSwap’s journey went even further by introducing a new pool called <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/%EF%B8%8Fbuilding-on-2-0-with-eth2snow-and-sharedstake-partnership-%EF%B8%8F-5ca251f8e1a0">eth2SNOW</a> designed to incentivize Eth2 adoption. SnowSwap’s <a href="https://snowswap.org/ethsnow/">eth2SNOW pool</a> aims to create new markets and utility via the ability to enter, exit, and swap between popular eth2 staking services with low slippage. This pool includes vETH2, aETH by ANKR, CRETH2 by CREAM, WETH. eth2SNOW provides a few key advantages for users:</p>



<ul><li>Enables users to conveniently enter and exit Eth2 staking services using WETH</li><li>Allows users to optimize for the highest APY % with low slippage swaps</li><li>Alleviates minimum ETH entry required for aETH</li><li>Liquidity providers gain exposure to Eth2 staking and earn a portion of swap fees</li></ul>



<p>In general, providing liquidity to SnowSwap’s pools provides a simpler and more cost effective way to gain exposure to a basket of yield-bearing assets with the added benefit of receiving a portion of swap fees. When a user provides liquidity to a SnowSwap pool, they receive either ySNOW, ycrvSNOW, btcSNOW, eth2SNOW tokens depending on the pool. Liquidity providers can stake these tokens to earn additional yield in the form of SNOW, SnowSwap’s governance token. 80% of the total SNOW tokens will be distributed to SnowSwap liquidity providers via liquidity mining rewards designed to bootstrap liquidity as well as the SnowSwap community.</p>



<h2>Progressing towards decentralization with The Snow DAO</h2>



<p>The SnowSwap team envisions The Snow DAO to play an important role in the future of SnowSwap. In this vision, <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/f-k-making-it-rain-were-making-it-snow-e60b64ad1292">SNOW</a> would grant users the ability to vote on governance proposals to modify or add to the SnowSwap protocol. For example, a future proposal could be voted in that distributes swap fees to SNOW holders. Nonetheless, the SnowSwap team<a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/snow-whats-next-29639c181732"> also believes </a>that poorly executed token governance can slow down the growth of a protocol. For this reason,&nbsp; they want to explore the possibilities with the community and collaborate to forge a path towards decentralization together. For example, one idea floated by the SnowSwap team was having community-based executives. In the meantime, the SnowSwap team covers the cost of development via the 10% of SNOW given to the Dev Fund on a 3-year vesting schedule. Additionally, 8% of SNOW was issued to the SnowSwap Foundation, a treasury used to fund initiatives and incentivize the growth of the ecosystem such as security audits, partner programs, and grants.</p>



<h3>Growing the SNOW community with positive-sum feedback loops</h3>



<p>At its core, SnowSwap is exploring the possibilities of forging symbiotic relationships leveraging the positive-sum nature of DeFi. Its pools provide liquidity between tokens staked in various DeFi protocols, creating a market to swap these tokens which had previously been so fragmented and illiquid. This encourages users to engage with these tokens and in turn creates additional utility for their respective communities. Members of these communities who use SnowSwap, earning them SNOW rewards, then also become members of the SnowSwap community. You can probably see where this leads… the more projects SnowSwap provides utility to, the more the communities grow, and so on to form a positive sum feedback loop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In line with this positive-sum mentality, The SnowSwap Foundation will invest in initiatives and teams which add value to the SnowSwap ecosystem. This strategy referred to as ‘Offensive Forkability’ supports community experimentation and encourages innovation. For example, grants could be funded to explore protocol design experiments. The goal of this strategy is to create network value by collaborating with SnowSwap to disincentivize vampire attacks. In other words, the strategy embodies the phrase: “If you can’t beat them, join them.”</p>



<h2>So what’s in store for SnowSwap?</h2>



<p>SnowSwap is keeping busy between new partnerships and crossing community milestones. The self-proclaimed army of “White Walkers&#8221; continues to grow with recently launched dedicated communities for its SnowSwap users in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India. <a href="https://twitter.com/Quantstamp/status/1343744581007933440?s=20">Quantstamp reviewed SnowSwap’s contracts</a> clearing the path to more major partnerships. Meanwhile, the eth2SNOW pool made in partnership with ANKR now has over 1000 ETH tokens. And now, it’s been<a href="https://twitter.com/snow_swap/status/1353059315968479232"> announced</a> that 1inch is integrating SnowSwap’s liquidity pools. SnowSwap pools will likely see increased trading volume from DEX aggregators and earn more trading fees for liquidity providers as a result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the sound of it, there’s even more brewing behind the scenes. SnowSwap told us that they have 5 major partners that they plan to reveal in the near future. So don’t be surprised to see new potential pools, tokenized assets and/or other developments coming soon. To be the first to hear about these new partnerships, we recommend you follow SnowSwap on the platform of your choice: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/CSSJTs4">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/Snow_Swap">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/snow_swap">Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>If you haven’t already, we recommend you go <a href="https://snowswap.org/">check out SnowSwap</a> and see how its low slippage AMM design can offer you more convenience and utility.<br><br><br><em>Disclosure: This post is part of our paid promotional DeFi Pulse Drop series; We’ve partnered with SnowSwap to help educate and inform the community about their protocol.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Yield farming allows projects to bootstrap their communities through incentives created by distributing their protocol’s token, essentially killing two birds with one stone. While these farming opportunities are open to all participants, making the most of these opportunities requires a certain amount of capital and expertise. And nowadays, yield farming has practically become a full-time job.</p>



<p>Harvest Finance set out to make life easier for farmers big and small. It allows users to farm as a collective to achieve the best risk-adjusted rate for a given asset. Launched on September 1st, 2020 in the midst of the yield farming craze with the slogan, “Bread for the People”, <a href="https://harvest.finance/">Harvest Finance</a> has gone on to become one of the largest yield aggregators with a vibrant community from all over the world. With farming having become the new norm, using a yield aggregator like Harvest Finance is like using a tractor instead of a manual plow; it’ll take less effort and ultimately be more efficient.</p>



<h2>Farming at Scale with Harvest Finance</h2>



<p>If you’re new to farming, it seems rather simple. Typically, you deposit a token, stablecoin, or liquidity pool token into a farm to earn tokens at a variable APR. You could simply deposit your assets and come back later to harvest your yield, but you’d be missing out. Manually harvesting and compounding your yields to achieve a higher APY means covering all the gas costs involved. For smaller farmers, the gas costs involved in this process can really start to eat into your returns. Not to mention, you’d need to meticulously calculate and track your APY in order to make sure it was even worth your time or the opportunity cost.</p>



<p>When a user deposits assets into Harvest to farm, they receive fTokens (i.e. fUSDC) which represent a yield-bearing version of the asset. fTokens can be redeemed for the underlying asset at any time. Depositors receive 70% of the profits generated from farming via Harvest as well as FARM token rewards. The remaining 30% is sent to a protocol token buyback and profit sharing program, but more on that later. As the first yield aggregator to adopt a performance-based fee structure, Harvest never charged a withdraw fee as others did. I know what you’re thinking: Why would I give up 30% of my profits when I can farm by myself?</p>



<p>Farming as a collective comes with its advantages compared to going it alone. It can be helpful to think of it as “farming at scale” to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency. If you opted to farm with Harvest Finance in the scenario above, your deposit would automatically compound for a higher APY when possible. Best of all, Harvest covers the gas costs associated with executing farming strategies and compounding deposits. The advantages of Harvest’s collective farming and FARM token design don’t end there though.</p>



<h3>FARM token aligns stakeholders of the Harvest Cooperative</h3>



<p>The goal of the Harvest Cooperative is to become the world’s largest farming cooperative making the latest yield farming techniques accessible to anyone, even those who are currently underbanked. In order to achieve this goal, the farmers of the Harvest Cooperative pool together resources to earn profits and create additional utility and value for its community of Harvest stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the heart of the Harvest Cooperative is Harvest’s FARM token which incentivizes participation, governs Harvest Finance, and allows users to benefit from the performance of the platform. At launch, FARM started with an initial supply of 0. Harvest Finance bootstrapped its community completely by offering FARM token rewards to depositors and liquidity providers. Only 690,420 FARM will be minted over 4 years with a current emission rate of 4.4% per week. At the time of writing, roughly 50% of FARM tokens have been minted so far. FARM tokens are distributed as follows: 70% of FARM tokens go to depositors and liquidity pool providers, 10% of tokens are vested over 4 years to the Operational Treasury to pay for additional development and promotion, and finally 20% are vested over 4 years to the Development Team.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/H1p0SHH5s-9KmMUH4gDeF9w8yCqiNUNQzmpZGzpi5t8G4JalzDe6hdhUK9jk8CBhafbgqyrasyWkHZ7mQ4_hdYKZfGA-uXMtyZHe2Ewl-oYfZ2JaJ62axGOef2RMRDKOFxfw0hhl" alt=""/></figure>



<h4>FARM Buybacks and Profit Sharing Pool</h4>



<p>As previously mentioned, 30% of all the profits generated by Harvest are converted to USDC and used to buy FARM tokens off the market. These FARM tokens are then distributed to Harvest Cooperative members with FARM tokens staked in Harvest’s Profit Sharing Pool. FARM buybacks create natural demand for FARM and are fueled purely by how much profit Harvest is able to generate for its users. The idea is that everyone in the Harvest Cooperative from farmers earning token incentives to the initiatives funded by the Operational Treasury benefit when the value of FARM increases further aligning the different Harvest stakeholders.</p>



<h3>Harvest Cooperative is able to steer growth and adoption together</h3>



<p>The Harvest Cooperative is incentivized to make changes that help the platform grow. Unlike an individual farmer, the Harvest Cooperative has a budget of sorts which it can use to collectively pay for things. FARM holders can create and vote on proposals for new strategies, protocol changes, or even initiatives to be funded by the Operational Treasury. This allows the Harvest Cooperative to stay on top of the latest yield farming strategies. Harvest was the first yield aggregator to release a farming strategy for SWRV, UNI, and Idle Finance. The treasury can also be used to incentivize users to participate in more profitable farms for the Cooperative. The Harvest community also makes use of the treasury to fund programs like creativity contests, bounties programs, and prizes for developer challenges which we’ll cover a bit more later on.</p>



<h3>Farming as a collective offers additional forms of risk mitigation</h3>



<p>Not only can pooling resources fund the development of new strategies, it also can be used to make farming <a href="https://farm.chainwiki.dev/en/security">more sustainable through test suites</a>, ongoing <a href="https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest/tree/master/audits">audits</a> and <a href="https://immunefi.com/bounty/harvest/">security bug bounties</a>.</p>



<h4>GRAIN reparations after USDC/USDT vaults exploited</h4>



<p>On October 26, 2020, an attacker was able to use a flash loan to <a href="https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-flashloan-economic-attack-post-mortem-3cf900d65217">steal 12.5% of funds from Harvest&#8217;s USDC and USDT vaults via an exploit</a>, resulting in a shared loss of $33.8M. The Harvest Community <a href="https://snapshot.page/#/farm/proposal/QmYF62qGaqyHAXt88Hmxise6CFaSWxnTmi5VedZ3VX8Zy2">voted to provide reparations to those affected by the exploit</a> in the form of an <a href="https://medium.com/harvest-finance/announcing-the-grain-claims-portal-20dd12c4f631">IOU token known as GRAIN</a>. Those affected were able to<a href="https://claim.harvest.finance/"> claim their share</a> of the $2.48M returned by the attacker as well as GRAIN tokens. Each week 0.5% of the total FARM emissions are sent to reparation pools, GRAIN buyback and FARM/GRAIN liquidity pool, up to the amount lost in the attack. Creating an incentivized FARM/GRAIN pool creates the liquidity necessary to support the buyback program and allows GRAIN holders to receive more FARM rewards for staking their liquidity as well. For those curious, <a href="https://duneanalytics.com/0xBoxer/-grain">this dashboard</a> has some interesting stats regarding the amount of GRAIN claimed. Solo farmers are often forced to accept losses due to attacks, but as you can see collective farming with an on-going revenue stream offers potential ways to remedy situations such as this.</p>



<h2>Harvest Cooperative has a strong sense of identity</h2>



<p>Even though Harvest community members are from all around the world (with a notable presence in the Chinese DeFi community), Harvest Cooperative has a strong identity and incentive structure that is welcoming of all. Harvest has previously affirmed their belief that financial inclusion is important for everyone, especially the unbanked and the underbanked. An understated benefit of farming together is that Harvest Cooperative is able express their values and give back to the community as a collective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the start, Harvest Finance community has had an appreciation for memes as made evident by their Farmer Chad logo. Anyone who keeps up with DeFi on Twitter has probably seen countless memes of Farmer Chad. This is no coincidence; In the spirit of its #BreadForThePeople slogan, Harvest frequently hosts creativity contests where users are rewarded for their creative contributions to Harvest Cooperative. <a href="https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-finance-farm-arts-creativity-contest-round-4-festive-edition-3ba3e5843da2">The most recent Creativity Competition</a>’s theme is “Celebrating the Festive Season”. The cool part about these competitions is that it allows those without the capital necessary to farm to benefit from Harvest Cooperative’s success.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the introduction of yield farming two months ago, DeFi has been growing at breakneck speed. Total Value Locked (TVL) has <a href="https://defipulse.com/">increased 5.6X and reached its all-time high of $6.77B</a>. New protocols, platforms, and new investment opportunities are launched week after week, making it hard to keep up even for the most sophisticated users in the space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This exponential growth has made it increasingly complex for users to efficiently select the best yield farming opportunities while reducing their exposure to risks. And it is even harder for inexperienced users who are looking to have exposure to DeFi protocols. These users don&#8217;t know where to start due to the complexity of these systems, and the lack of a single product that can help them make informed decisions without diving into multiple Twitter threads, blog posts, Discord groups, and complicated platforms.</p>



<p>Here is where <a href="https://delphi.akropolis.io/summary">Delphi</a> comes in.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is Delphi?</strong></h2>



<p>Delphi is an easy to use platform that allows users to automate their DeFi lives. Their platform offers curated access to different yield farming opportunities across DeFi, by providing non-technical users with a clean and simple UI to help them take advantage of them.</p>



<p>Through its platform, users have access to different investment options depending on their risk appetite. These options are presented as Savings, Investments, DCA (dollar-cost averaging), and Staking. Delphi is built by the Akropolis team and is the second product after <a href="https://sparta.akropolis.io/">Sparta</a> built on the <a href="https://github.com/akropolisio/akropolisOS">AkropolisOS</a>.</p>



<p>Only the Savings option is available, but the Investments, DCA, and Staking options will soon go live, as well. For a full view of their releases schedule, you can <a href="https://www.notion.so/b390a85d87124796b0b008b20e6ab38e?v=387bc54a16e34bf2b8f7328b839eebc2">check out Akropolis&#8217;s roadmap here.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>The two most exciting options that can be accessed through Delphi are the &#8220;Savings account,&#8221; and “DCA” options:</p>



<h3><strong>Savings account</strong></h3>



<p>The Savings account option provides users with a value proposition similar to that of traditional finance products, in which users can access products that offer predictable returns at low costs. The key difference here is that Delphi manages allocations across a wide array of stable coin DeFi pools in different protocols to take advantage of yield farming opportunities. In this way, Delphi offers higher APYs, while canceling volatility and exposure to impermanent loss.</p>



<h2><strong>DCA&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The DCA option brings a much-needed feature to the DeFi space that has been traditionally offered by centralized exchanges: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">dollar-cost averaging</a>. DCA gives users a straightforward way to gain exposure to assets by reducing the impact of volatility on the overall purchases.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How does Delphi work?</strong></h2>



<p>Delphi seeks to lower the barrier to entry for the least experienced DeFi users and be a compelling tool for experienced users at the same time. To achieve that, it offers a straightforward and intuitive interface. The “Savings” &amp; Staking” options will be the first to go live on August 24th. So we will focus on the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option and on how to leverage it to make the most out of your investments.</p>



<ol><li>First, remember that to use the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option, you must own stablecoins such as DAI, USDC, or sUSD.</li><li>Once you have stable coins in your wallet, go to the <a href="https://delphi.akropolis.io/">Delphi website</a>, click on the right-hand side top corner on the &#8220;App&#8221; button, and connect your wallet when the pop up requests you to do so.</li><li>Once your wallet is connected, you&#8217;ll be ready to start using the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option.</li><li>When clicking on the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option, you will select among one of five pools in which to allocate your stablecoins and create your savings account. Starting tomorrow, you will be able to pick among any of the following pools:<ul><li>Compound DAI pool</li><li>Compound USDC pool</li><li>sUSD Curve pool</li><li>Y Curve</li><li>bUSD Curve pool</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>Pools have an option called &#8220;View Pool Details,&#8221; where you can click to find out the details about each pool and compare them to decide in which one to invest your savings. &#8220;View Pool Details&#8221; shows the total liquidity and asset weight, daily volume, gas costs, and, most importantly, the pools&#8217; APY and the approximate weekly rewards that will be received in each of the tokens awarded in each pool.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XfWoxhKABSnqAXAm3oYLetwE8qZ1_1Vf25Nv4Rw_Ux4mplgdxKJIxXLpkpPJUHyvvdAzRV7s8sPYpUE8BNwKAHb3AxCeBFRB3GmOEEiuNTGkg-tfhI83H8nLpC7DLXud9jhxrGLJ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Once you make up your mind, you can invest your savings in a single pool by clicking on the &#8220;Allocate&#8221; option in each pool. But you can also diversify among two, three or more pools by clicking on the &#8220;Allocate&#8221; option on the bottom right-hand corner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wXZBLNX8tVNhz81dJjqiMciJFOaD7PWBw4DIHMzdlChYsIXnJsqZ8Q2dmhbbm4MgmRvx2ESfZbWx0yhfzv1FkSFSSkmVirl7ZCF1OPzZjKLd31bsLVvbd3ts4vpQjobdDOL5ndzy" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The &#8220;Allocate&#8221; option is one of the coolest features of the Delphi &#8220;Savings&#8221; option. It allows you to diversify your savings by investing in more than one pool by performing one single transaction, at lower costs than making a separate investment in each pool by accessing different protocols.</p>



<p>As for the Staking, it’s a simple supply of liquidity to the AKRO-only pool at the moment. In the future, this section will be expanded &amp; include Akropolis governance pools for Akropolis products.</p>



<p><strong>Bonus (coming soon): </strong>with Delphi, you can also rebalance your allocation between pools in one single transaction.</p>



<p>Finally, once you have allocated your savings in one or more pools, you can track all of your investments by clicking on the &#8220;My Summary&#8221; option, which allows you to track all of your pools, APYs &amp; harvest in one place.</p>



<h2><strong>Delphi Governance</strong></h2>



<p>The Delphi platform will be governed by holders of the ADEL governance token, which will be minted over six months after its mainnet launch. In a very similar fashion to YFI, ADEL will not have a pre-sale or pre-mine. It will only be earnt through liquidity provision of stablecoins, AKRO, and other selected tokens and active governance participation, and just 5% will be reserved for development, audits &amp; other costs.</p>



<p>The most important parameters will be the following:</p>



<ul><li>ADEL is not just a governance token — it will have a shared claim on Delphi&#8217;s future fees (exit/entry fees, performance fees, exchange referral fees, etc.).</li><li>60,000,000 ADEL will be minted as fixed supply and distributed linearly over six months. Community governance will have the option to amend the ADEL monetary policy to introduce inflation/deflation/elasticity of supply.</li><li>95% goes to active users/LPs, including community rewards [unlocked from week 2].</li><li>5% goes to development, maintenance, and audit.</li><li>A product governance DAO will be created before or shortly after full mainnet launch.</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/akropolis/august-2020-akropolis-monthly-update-part-1-of-n-a51f265073a9">You can learn more about AKRO, Akropolis governance token, and ADEL, in this blog post.</a></p>



<h2><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>As DeFi continues to grow exponentially and more protocols and platforms continue to launch weekly, complexity across the space will also increase. Even the most sophisticated users will start struggling to keep track of all the different investment opportunities and new systems in this scenario. This is where platforms such as Delphi come in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By solving all the complexities in the background and providing a clean UI for any user to easily invest, rebalance, and monitor their allocations, Delphi provides a very compelling value proposition that can make any user comfortable with interacting with DeFi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is also exciting that the governance token distribution that Delphi will pursue puts the users of the protocol first and will allocate 95% of all minted tokens to the community.</p>
