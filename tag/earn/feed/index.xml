										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lately, we&#8217;ve been receiving a lot of feedback from those of you in the community about new features and metrics you&#8217;d like to see included on DeFi Pulse. We want to let you know that we appreciate this feedback as well as your support of DeFi Pulse.</p>
<p>And needless to say, we&#8217;re excited to watch DeFi grow too! Which is why we&#8217;re delighted to announce the new <a href="http://defipulse.com/income">Earn Income</a> feature of DeFi Pulse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/income"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-7510" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Selection_071-263x300.jpg" alt="earn income" width="656" height="750" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Selection_071-263x300.jpg 263w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Selection_071-768x878.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Selection_071.jpg 819w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" /></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no doubt that lending is one of DeFi&#8217;s most popular use cases. As it currently stands, DeFi lending services make up a majority of the top 10 DeFi Pulse leaderboard rankings. It only seems natural that DeFi Pulse provide users with insights into this area of the market.</p>
<p>So in addition to our leaderboard rankings and <a href="/blog/meet-the-defi-list/">The DeFi List</a>, this section of DeFi Pulse helps users track trends in the market and compare services for the best DeFi interest rates.</p>
<h3>Compare interest rates in a snap</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s super easy to use! Simply select the asset you&#8217;d like to lend out from the list of currently supported tokens: WETH, DAI, USDC, ZRX, BAT, REP, WBTC, MKR, KNC, TUSD, or LINK. Next, enter the quantity. And then, our tool searches DeFi to give you the best options between services like Compound, dYdX, Fulcrum, and Nuo Network.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll instantly see your potential monthly earnings at a glance. DeFi Pulse&#8217;s <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">Earn Income</a> section makes it easy to compare the finer details of your loan including Interest Rates (APY), Term length, and desired level of Permissioning like KYC.</p>
<h3>Put your money to work</h3>
<p>What are you waiting for? Go ahead and <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">give it a try</a> today! You could be earning passive income with those tokens sitting in your wallet. And don&#8217;t forget to l<span style="font-weight: 400;">et us what you think in the Concourse <a href="https://discord.gg/y7qSf4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/defipulse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@DefiPulse</a> on Twitter.</span></p>
