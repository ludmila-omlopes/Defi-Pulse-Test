										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In traditional finance, leaner banking models without physical locations allowed online banks to cut costs and pass the benefits onto the customer. Banking services built on decentralized networks like Ethereum can offer even more advantages by further reducing operational costs such as securing assets which would traditionally be held in custody. Non-custodial protocols like DeFiner allow users to access savings and loans anytime, anywhere with an internet connection putting you in control of your money.</p>



<p><a href="https://definer.org/">DeFiner</a> is a non-custodial protocol which aims to be a better banking experience than traditional banks by making full use of the disruptive innovations happening in DeFi. Since its founding in 2018, DeFiner has gone on to <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/79450/definerorg-wins-detroit-fintech-challenge/">win the Detroit Fintech Challenge in August 2019</a> and participated in the <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/announcing-the-inaugural-class-of-techstars-hub71-accelerator">Techstars Accelerator</a> and Microsoft Startup Program. Partnerships with both names from traditional tech firms like Microsoft and Consensus Labs as well as names from DeFi like Wyre and Kyber have helped DeFiner move closer towards its goal. DeFiner envisions a complete range of DeFi banking services starting with its first two products: peer-to-peer lending and DeFi savings.</p>

<h2>DeFiner’s Taurus savings takes advantage of existing money legos</h2>



<p>DeFiner <a href="https://blog.definer.org/taurus-launch">launched Taurus Savings Accounts</a> in late November 2020. Taurus Savings Accounts work similar to DeFi money markets you’re likely familiar with. You can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow against your collateral. While loans on the DeFiner protocol are overcollateralized, DeFiner takes advantage of existing DeFi protocols to offer its users borrowing and lending interest rates typically better than the industry average. You see DeFiner takes a portion of the collateral held in its reserves and lends it out on popular money markets like Compound or Maker to earn interest. In other words, DeFiner increases capital utilization to up to more than 85% to reduce the spread between borrowing and lending rates. </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that while this does indeed lower the spread, it comes at the cost of added composability and economic risks. Imagine a scenario where the value of a collateral asset drops quickly or a bug is found and exploited and Compound is unable to cover existing debts. This in turn may mean DeFiner could also be left with insufficient collateral unable to cover existing debts.</p>



<p>When things don’t go as planned, DeFiner allows borrowers to pay back their loans with their collateral. Triggering a self-liquidation sells your desired collateral at a 2% discount in order to cover your debt and avoid a forced liquidation, which bears a 5% collateral discount. Both discounted rates are designed to attract liquidators to participate in collateral auctions and ensure debts can reliably be covered in a timely manner.</p>



<p>DeFiner protocol uses its native token FIN to reward its most active users as well as incentivize users to help meet demand in highly sought after lending markets like USDC and DAI. DeFiner protocol releases new FIN tokens via its Proof of Premium (POP) distribution mechanism. Proof of Premium verifies the premium the prover (lenders and borrowers) generated in a specified time interval. To sum up POP, the more capital committed by a user for longer time periods and higher interest rates results in more FIN tokens being rewarded through the POP mining mechanism. FIN token holders can vote on the follow four categories: lending platform changes (i.e. loan to collateral value ratios, transaction fees, etc.), determining how platform fees are distributed, determining the distribution of FIN token rewards, and electing the board of directors for the DeFiner Organization, a non-profit entity which maintains and promotes the growth of the DeFiner lending platform and community. Currently, 100% of transaction fees and 10% of all interest generated by loans on the DeFiner protocol are distributed to FIN token holders. Learn more about FIN token and Proof of Premium <a href="https://github.com/DeFinerOrg/whitepaper/wiki/DeFiner-Whitepaper#definer-token-fin-economy">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>Decentralized finance has been a series of innovations each one building on the next. That’s why it’s nice to see DeFiner exploring ways to utilize secondary money markets to improve its own money market for the benefit of its users. DeFiner plans to release a mobile app in the future. With the ever increasing popularity of mobile banking, this feels like a natural progression of DeFiner’s mission to reduce friction for users. <a href="https://twitter.com/definerorg">Follow DeFiner on Twitter</a> to keep up with the latest updates. And if you’re curious how DeFiner’s design impacts interest rates, we urge you to check out <a href="https://app.definer.org/">Taurus</a> and compare it to other popular lending platforms. Thanks for reading.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As you likely already know, MakerDAO’s DAI is a decentralized stablecoin pegged to $1 and backed by many different collateral types. Historically, there has been high demand for DAI causing it to rise above it’s $1 peg at times. To encourage the necessary inflation to bring DAI back down to $1, MakerDAO can add more collateral types and raise the total amount of DAI that can be minted from existing collateral types. While these changes do tend to bring DAI back on peg, they also add new risk parameters and complexity to the system. Some community members have raised concerns that these risks could compound over time, increasing the odds that DAI could become undercollateralized in a crisis and MakerDAO may be forced to trigger an emergency shutdown. If MakerDAO were to ever collapse, it would send ripples through the DeFi ecosystem due to the widespread use of DAI. <a href="https://hakka.finance/">Hakka Finance</a> built <a href="https://3fmutual.com/">3F Mutual</a> for this very reason so users could hedge against this economic risk with lower premiums and better market-making mechanisms.</p>



<p>Hakka Finance is an engineering team from Taiwan who have been building in the DeFi space since mid-2019. Currently, their two major products are 3F Mutual and <a href="http://blackholeswap.com/">BlackHoleSwap</a> (more on them in a bit), but the team has a history of building cool DeFi projects. The Hakka Finance team were finalists of the Kyber DeFi Virtual Hackathon in September 2019 with their <a href="https://devpost.com/software/crypto-structured-fund">Crypto Structure Fund</a> and also previously built <a href="https://github.com/Robin-and-friends/tCDP">a fungible version of CDPs</a> as well as <a href="https://hakka.finance/">other interesting projects</a>. Their stated goal is to build products that “allow users to pursue financial sovereignty.” The team plans to keep building until they’ve established a mature ecosystem of exceptional DeFi products controlled and governed by the community of HAKKA token holders. But before we dive too far into HAKKA, let’s explore their flagship product 3F Mutual to understand more about the Hakka Finance ecosystem.</p>



<h2>How does 3F Mutual work?</h2>



<p>Third Floor Mutual or <a href="https://3fmutual.com/">3F Mutual</a> is a rainy day fund designed to act as collective insurance against the risk of MakerDAO collapsing. You can purchase insurance from 3F Mutual to hedge against the economic risk of MakerDAO which can be claimed if the MakerDAO Emergency Shutdown Module is activated while your insurance is still active.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/D8VdEmKGHRdMvmH1PHp_ubO_KDnh1sd5Y688yISWn6P0IdBDwFIUcmowxdS2Y3taKCsrv25e3MqDptbNttByMd3W5Zc2Dk3TULp_lshAD_VKTP-7CArx2t2YNg5sSNGbPyvP_Chn" alt="" width="555" height="239"/></figure>



<p>3F Mutual uses an automated market maker (AMM) design which allows users to purchase insurance underwritten by 3F Mutual’s fund pool at any time. In a nutshell, there are three roles involved in 3F’s design: underwriters, insurance buyers, and insurance agents. Underwriters provide capital to 3F Mutual and earn dividends proportional to their share of the pool. As the name implies, insurance buyers pay insurance fees to receive coverage for a limited time. Insurance agents, as you may have guessed, refer new users to 3F and collect a referral bonus for doing so.<br></p>



<p>One key aspect of 3F’s design is that the insurance fees paid by insurance buyers becomes the pool used to compensate insurance buyers in the event MakerDAO’s emergency shutdown is activated. Additionally, underwriters receive dividends in the form of 15% of all insurance fees paid to the pool. When you buy insurance, you receive both insured units and shares of the pool. Shares, unlike units, never expire and entitle the holder to receive underwriter dividends. In this way, you’re acting as both an insurance buyer and an underwriter for the pool. You can even choose to buy 0-day insurance at the base price effectively purchasing shares with no insurance included.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/z08QP8psDlG5YMzrNtqtwqo_ab6c-PgOmZjUMDVcTkpHHcsQoU8FvJsRRIhiQyTlDYsaif24q0q7pxd7E_n9T1TidSMt0XH7T23YYZS79UCNj1leVbwUROhoa9hHKv-Kfo8NCnmt" alt="" width="437" height="118"/></figure>



<p>Every time you buy insurance from 3F you pay insurance fees based on the number of insurance units and how many days of coverage you want. The fee you pay when buying insurance is multiplied by a rate set to 100% per insured day with a 1% depreciation. In other words, you can get a discount if you buy longer insurance coverage. You can only buy a maximum of 100 days of coverage.</p>



<h3>Insurance Agents</h3>



<p>3F Mutual features insurance agents which allows users to earn referral fees. Anyone can spend 0.01 ETH to register a unique name in 3F Mutual to become the insurance agent. Agents can build a personal profile with a profile picture and opening statement powered by 3BOX and IPFS. Agents receive a bonus for every insurance purchase made with their referral link. Bonuses increase with more referrals in a tiered system. Learn more about <a href="https://3fmutual.hostedwiki.co/pages/In-depth%20tutorials">3F’s insurance agent system</a>.</p>



<h2>3F Mutual incentivizes early participation</h2>



<p>If MakerDAO’s emergency shutdown is activated, the total amount you’re eligible to claim is based on your number of active insurance units versus the total number of active units. When your units / coverage expires, you still keep your shares of the pool as an underwriter. With each new unit of insurance purchased, the base price per insurance unit rises and more fees are paid to the pool. As the pool continues to grow, 3F is able to provide larger amounts of insurance capacity which in turn further increases revenue. This positive cycle rewards early participants due to the fact that shares never expire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine you’re an early insurance buyer, you’d pay a smaller base price per unit/share than a future buyer and even after your insurance expires you’d continue to earn dividends as an underwriter. And since you receive the same number of shares as you do units purchased (even if you choose 0 days of coverage), the optimal strategy is to purchase short-term insurance in the early stages of 3F Mutual to maximize your dividends and then purchase more coverage right before MakerDAO would trigger an emergency shutdown. Of course, no one can predict if or when MakerDAO might trigger it with 100% accuracy. That’s why 3F can be thought of like a rainy day fund which produces dividends during sunny days.</p>



<p>Since its launch in mid-September 2020, 3F Mutual has already gotten a fair bit of traction. At the time of writing, there are currently ~1879 ETH in the pool, 5738929 total shares, 4519 active insurances, and 780 agents.</p>



<h2>How are 3F Mutual insurance fees distributed?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Destination</strong></td><td><strong>Percentage</strong></td><td><strong>Side note</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Dividends</td><td>15%</td><td>Equally distribute to all shareholders</td></tr><tr><td>IIP</td><td>10%</td><td>Reserve for Insurance Improvement Proposals</td></tr><tr><td>External</td><td>20%</td><td>Allocate to insurance agent (0~16%) and vault</td></tr><tr><td>Pool</td><td>55%</td><td>Compensations for MakerDAO Emergency Shutdown</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><br>We already covered dividends, agent bonuses, and the pool of funds set aside for compensation, but that 10% for Insurance Improvement Proposals (IIP) is where 3F Mutual fits into the wider HAKKA ecosystem. This IIP reserve is held with 3F Mutual’s vault and is governed by HAKKA token holders. HAKKA holders vote on IIPs to determine how best to develop, maintain, or upgrade 3F Mutual’s protocol through Hakka Finance’s governance system.</p>



<h1>Hakka Ecosystem</h1>



<p>Hakka Finance aims to be a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), distributing HAKKA tokens to its community members in order to decentralize governance. HAKKA tokens were originally sold to cover the team’s development costs when the market turned bearish in 2019. At present, 60% of all HAKKA tokens are being distributed to the community via liquidity mining and other incentive programs.<br><img loading="lazy" alt="Image for post" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/5jQMvll3P79uGBSIMdCtxMrM7JBL4TJd1RvAdsXxeCeIJEpW8Tf9Riztbcr0Gb_-RtNdnIAm2kybrG4RF1EiV8uV6YTZ5mZuAICdzBz2I_McbpQbqijM85zrhqurCnwc78dZLDPI" width="624" height="307"><br>The Hakka Finance team is committed to transparency providing the community with a <a href="https://medium.com/hakkafinance/hakka-finance-transparency-report-e75f025507dc">Transparency Report</a> and <a href="https://hakka-finance.gitbook.io/hakka-wiki/governance/governance-roadmap">Hakka’s governance roadmap</a>. In an <a href="https://medium.com/hakkafinance/financial-statements-of-hakka-finance-646674369a3d">updated financial statement from Sept. 2020</a>, Hakka Finance mentions that a significant portion of the total supply was burned and locking / vesting schedules were extended.</p>



<p>HAKKA token holders <a href="https://beta-gov.hakka.finance/#/">govern various parameters in Hakka Finance</a> products, like the IIP reserves mentioned. HAKKA governance also determines when to add <a href="https://medium.com/hakkafinance/hakka-reward-pools-v8-af51937ac068">new liquidity mining incentives</a>. Users can <a href="https://rewards.hakka.finance/pools">earn HAKKA tokens</a> by providing liquidity for purchasing insurance on 3F Mutual in addition to providing liquidity for HAKKA and BlackHoleSwap, Hakka Finance’s stablecoin DEX.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>BlackHoleSwap</h1>



<p>Created in July 2020, <a href="http://blackholeswap.com/">BlackHoleSwap</a> is a decentralized stablecoin exchange that can process transactions far exceeding its existing liquidity by tapping into lending protocols. BlackHoleSwap’s name is inspired by its goal to have the deepest liquidity in the universe. BlackHoleSwap leverages excess supply to borrow the necessary stablecoin when reserves are inadequate to perform a swap, lowering slippage and maximizing capital utilization. This adds what the Hakka team refers to as “virtual liquidity” to popular AMM models like Uniswap. Given the same amount of “real reserves,” BlackHoleSwap produces less slippage than many other DEXes and can even have “real reserves” as little as 0.<br><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/ZXhfK-ufRY_SwGojTSU8VDd2FkG2_PK2cLAihGZ-Hma5QTDuOOb1qcbAvLJ-HMwHBIRcg1XlaBenbzBbdnG8LXRLGdOYroRQpn3k0Vn8EzZ9VamOGY1KSklDXL58qnpRgFyk1TO_" width="624" height="391"></p>



<p>And because it is integrated with Compound, BlackHoleSwap can even mine COMP for the pool producing extra profit for liquidity providers. To learn more about the technical details behind BlackHoleSwap, I recommend you read the wiki found <a href="https://hakka-finance.gitbook.io/hakka-wiki/hakka-products/black-hole-swap-bhs">here</a>.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>Between <a href="https://3fmutual.com/">3F Mutual</a> and <a href="https://blackholeswap.com/swap">BlackHoleSwap</a>, the Hakka team has built interesting products with innovative features uniquely catered to the DeFi space. I’d argue they live up to their catch phrase of “Warped Spacetime with Crypto Native Primitives” because some of their features are a bit mind-bending. Given their track record, I’ll be eagerly awaiting whatever comes next from Hakka Finance. To stay on top of all the different products Hakka Finance is cooking up, check out <a href="https://hakka.finance/">their website</a> and follow them on <a href="https://twitter.com/hakkafinance">Twitter</a>.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-road-815297_1280-1-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8061"/></figure></div>



<p>On Thursday March 12, 2020, the price of Ether (ETH) dropped over 30% in about 24 hours. The result sent chain reaction rippling through DeFi in an event many will likely come to refer to as Black Thursday. DeFi users rushed to make transactions like trading on DEXes, paying off debts, bolstering collateral ratio, etc. The increased activity led to record-setting high gas prices at times exceeding 200 gwei. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with how gas prices work, think of it as an auction for the limited space in each block. Users desperate to get their transaction through start to outbid each other to get their transactions completed in a timely manner. And then, the ensuing &#8220;bidding wars&#8221; drive up gas prices and subsequently cause low-priced transactions to be stuck until things settle down. <strong><em>The bottom line is that the increased volume put a lot of stress on DeFi smart contracts along with the entire Ethereum network.</em> </strong>So we&#8217;ve decided to put together this status update to provide context for those unaware who may panic at the sight of the charts lately.</p>



<h4>Don&#8217;t panic. All is not lost and DeFi endured the test.</h4>



<p>I think it&#8217;s worth taking a moment to say: <em>there are safety measures in place for a reason.</em> When you install fire alarms and safety systems you hope you never need to use them, but know that there could always come a day when you have to. And if your home catches on fire, you don&#8217;t abandon the concept of living in homes altogether. You rebuild your home and this time you build it bit safer and better overall. We, as a community, have been tested before and have only grown stronger for these trials. A decentralized financial market is a market worth fighting for and the truth is&#8230; DeFi remains one of the most exciting and innovative spaces on this planet and will only continue to grow and evolve despite the occasional bump in the road.</p>



<p><em>High levels of network congestion affected the entire Ethereum network so we&#8217;ll only be addressing some of the more notable ways DeFi projects were affected by recent events.</em></p>



<h2>Maker</h2>



<p>While the exact issue is still <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/recent-market-activity-and-next-steps/">under investigation</a>, the dramatic increase in gas prices caused Maker&#8217;s price feed oracle to remain stuck at ~$166 despite the market dipping almost 15% lower at times. High gas prices also affected Keeper bots, preventing many from liquidating undercollateralized loans. Unfortunately, some Keepers were able to bid on and purchase collateral ETH for 0 DAI. And, many Vault owners reported 100% of their collateral being liquidated. </p>



<p>A Maker community call was held to determine the best plan of action. Maker put out <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/recent-market-activity-and-next-steps/">a blog post</a> addressing the situation and proposed various parameters which could be adjusted to prevent further issues. MKR holders have since <a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/executive-proposal/adjust-multiple-risk-parameters">approved changes</a> including lowering debt ceilings, lowering stability fees, changing auction parameters to allow keepers additional time and limit the total number of auctions.</p>



<p>Among the approved parameter changes was delaying the Debt Auction, designed to cover the +$4M in remaining system debt, in an attempt to give the community more time to prepare.</p>



<h3>MKR Debt Auction</h3>



<p>Maker is designed with a pool of DAI called the <em>Maker Buffer</em> reserved to cover debts in situations like this<em>.</em> However, the Maker Buffer was unable to cover the deficit caused by the tremendous amount of liquidations. As stated in its <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/">whitepaper</a>, the Maker Protocol will now trigger a Debt Auction where MKR is minted and sold for DAI to re-collateralize the system. </p>



<p><strong>Here are the details for the auction according to<a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/mkr-debt-auction-announcement-and-details/"> MakerDAO&#8217;s blog</a>: </strong></p>



<ul><li>Start time: March 19, 6:25 am ET (March 19, 10:25 am UTC)</li><li> MKR will be auctioned off in lots for 50,000 Dai</li><li>According to parameters of the Maker Protocol as determined by governance, the auction works as in the following example:<ul><li>The protocol offers a Keeper (bidder) a lot of 250 MKR for 50,000 Dai, which translates to a price of 200 Dai/MKR. </li><li>A second keeper bids 50,000 Dai but only requires 230 MKR, which translates to a price of 217 Dai/MKR. </li><li>The bid prices increase through the Keepers’ willingness to take slightly less MKR in exchange for 50,000 Dai. </li></ul></li><li>If no one bids on the first lot of 250 MKR, then the auction can be re-initialized after three days, offering 20% more MKR (300 MKR) for 50,000 Dai, which translates to a price of 166.66 Dai/MKR.</li><li>Finally, if there is at least one bid, and no one outbids it within 6 hours, the auction ends.</li></ul>



<p>Anyone is free to participate in the auction by running an Auction Keeper. Maker provides <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/how-to-run-your-own-auction-keeper-bot-in-mcd/">documentation on how to run an auction keeper bot</a> but no official front-end UI. However, there are some in the community working on making these systems more accessible for the auction.</p>



<h3>Dai Backstop Syndicate</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><a href="https://t.me/backstopsyndicate"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/backstopsyndicate-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8034"/></a></figure></div>



<p>We&#8217;re working with Dharma and many other community members to organize a community-led effort dubbed the <strong><a href="https://t.me/backstopsyndicate">DAI Backstop Syndicate</a></strong> to form a backstop in support of MKR and act as a buyer of last resort in the upcoming MKR auction.</p>



<p>The idea is to create pool contract that would give syndicate participants a way to participate in the auction process should MKR fall below a given price like 100 DAI / MKR.  The intention is to be a backstop, not necessarily buy the MKR nor will it provide liquidity for liquidations during Dai Surplus Auctions (flaps).</p>



<p>The contract will be designed so anyone could trigger an auction using pooled funds at the given price once auctions begin. At which point, all participants would be able to redeem the tokens they minted by supplying Dai for the equiv. Dai / MKR blend held by the pool.</p>



<p><strong><em>If you&#8217;re interested in participating, <a href="https://t.me/backstopsyndicate">join the telegram</a> to help organize, review<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1miS-snhSYBKwjQHM1MOPnLZZl9i2gj3zTcvuQWecV2M/edit#"> the proposal</a> and <a href="https://github.com/backstop-syndicate/dai-backstop-syndicate">Github repo</a> for full details</em></strong>.</p>



<h3>Nexus Mutual claims</h3>



<p>As of writing this, 3 out of the 11 <a href="https://nexustracker.io/claims">submitted claims</a> related to the MakerDAO incident have been denied by Nexus Mutual. Those with Nexus Mutual cover on MakerDAO have been <a href="https://twitter.com/NexusMutual/status/1238496725054230534">instructed to wait</a> for more complete information before submitting new claims.</p>



<h2>Compound</h2>



<p>Compound placed in its timelock three precautionary changes to how its protocol handles DAI in the case it becomes unpegged and mass liquidations are required.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Three changes have been queued in the Compound protocol timelock, as a precaution due to recent volatility:<br><br>A new price feed that allows DAI to become unpegged in a MakerDAO emergency shutdown;<br>Liquidation incentive 5% -&gt; 8% -&gt; 15%<br><br>These will only be activated if necessary.</p>&mdash; Compound Labs (@compoundfinance) <a href="https://twitter.com/compoundfinance/status/1238308271963828226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>Synthetix</h2>



<p>The high network congestion forced Synthetix to go down for short period of time as its rates provided by on-chain Chainlink oracles to go stale. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Selection_999064-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8028"/></figure>



<p>After some time, the system was brought back online and the Synthetix team released <a href="https://github.com/Synthetixio/SIPs/blob/master/SCCP/sccp-16.md">SCCP-16</a> which temporarily increased fee reclamation waiting period to an hour to accommodate extreme network congestion. This change was reverted after the congestion subsided.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Selection_999065-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8045"/></figure>



<h2>Aave</h2>



<p>Aave protocol also took measures to reduce the impact of MKR and DAI instability.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to the current instability of the DAI stablecoin system, our risk assessment team has decided to lower the LTV for future borrowers of both MKR and DAI to 1% as a safety measure to prevent possible abuse.

</div></figure>



<h2>dYdX</h2>



<p>Combating high gas costs, dYdX progressively increased its minimum trade size throughout the day on March 12. The first step was up to 10 ETH or 2000 DAI, it was ultimately raised as high as 40 ETH or 5000 DAI. By the evening of March 13, the min. trade size was restored back to normal (0.1 ETH or 20 DAI).</p>



<h2>DDEX</h2>



<p>DDEX incurred minor losses of $5373 which will be covered by its built-in insurance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2>Green on the board</h2>



<p>The silver lining of the day was that many smart contracts like Uniswap functioned performed as expected under the massive stress placed on the Ethereum network. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p><strong>Examining our DeFi rankings during these events, it was clear DEXes like Uniswap, DeFi lenders [like dYdX, Nuo, Robo-Advisor for Yield (RAY), and Dharma], and payment networks like xDai and Connext fared the best.</strong> All of which are DeFi smart contracts generally less impacted by price fluctuations and high gas prices with more diverse collateral options and/or lower risk yields.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Stress tests like these help expose cracks in DeFi smart contracts that can be repaired and improved upon. They also serve as important reminders to do your own research and plan accordingly for potential smart contract risks. DeFi is still a very young market and bumps in the road are to be expected. And when things get rough, remember what brought us here together as a community: the exciting prospect of a decentralized financial system open to all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DAI is an ERC20 token designed to maintain a peg to the US Dollar, also known as a stablecoin, generated and maintained by the <a href="https://makerdao.com/">Maker Protocol</a>. Every single DAI in existence has been generated by users <a href="https://defipulse.com/maker">locking collateral into Maker&#8217;s smart contract system</a> and opening what&#8217;s called a Vault.</p>



<p>When you open a Maker Vault, you lock in collateral such as ether (ETH) or BAT. And then, you’re able to generate or borrow up to 2/3 of the US dollar value of your collateral in DAI. In other words, your Vault&#8217;s ratio of collateral value to total debt in DAI must be above 150%.</p>



<p>For every 1 DAI, there is at least $1.50 worth of collateral locked into a Maker Vault. And if your collateral value falls, you must lock in more ETH, pay back some of your debt, or risk having the collateral in your Vault liquidated. When a Vault position is liquidated, the held collateral is automatically sold to pay back the debts in addition to a penalty fee for failing to keep your collateral ratio above 150%.</p>



<h2>Using Maker&#8217;s Oasis portal to borrow your first DAI</h2>



<p><strong>Navigate to Maker&#8217;s <a href="https://oasis.app/borrow">Oasis Borrow</a>.</strong><br>There are many ways to interface with a Maker Vault; Oasis is <a href="https://github.com/OasisDEX">open-source</a> and was developed by the Maker. </p>



<p><strong>Connect the wallet of your choice and click &#8216;Get Started&#8217;</strong><br><a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> is a browser extension commonly recommended for interacting with many DApps. Ledger and Trezor are hardware wallets. Wallet Connect and Coinbase Wallet allow you to scan a QR code to access Oasis via mobile wallet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019-1-1024x508.png" alt="" data-id="7995" data-full-url="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019-1.png" data-link="https://defipulse.com/blog/?attachment_id=7995" class="wp-image-7995"/></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><strong>Select a collateral type and click &#8216;Continue&#8217;</strong><br>ETH and BAT are the only supported collateral types as of writing this. In this example, we selected ETH.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999017-1-1024x510.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7996"/></figure>



<p><strong>Setup Vault and Set Allowance</strong><br>Follow the prompts to send a few transactions in preparation for opening your Maker Vault and generating DAI. We recommend referencing <a href="http://ethgasstation.info/">EthGasStation</a> for the latest gas prices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999016-1-1024x511.png" alt="" data-id="7997" data-full-url="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999016-1.png" data-link="https://defipulse.com/blog/?attachment_id=7997" class="wp-image-7997"/></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><strong>Deposit Collateral and Generate Dai</strong><br>Enter the amount of collateral you&#8217;d like to deposit and the amount of DAI you wish to generate. You cannot withdraw the collateral until you pay back any DAI you generate or borrow. Note, opening a Vault requires a minimum of 20 Dai to be generated. Click continue and confirm your transaction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999018-1024x510.png" alt="" data-id="7998" data-full-url="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999018.png" data-link="https://defipulse.com/blog/?attachment_id=7998" class="wp-image-7998"/></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><strong>Wait for your newly generated DAI to arrive in your wallet</strong><br>Once submitted, your transaction may take a moment depending on the gas price you paid. Finally, your transaction will be confirmed and your DAI should be available in your wallet.</p>



<h3>What can I use DAI for?</h3>



<p>DAI is one of the most liquid assets in the DeFi ecosystem. You can spend, save, lend, and tons more with your DAI. You can trade DAI for ETH, MKR, and many other ERC20 tokens at the best prices in DeFi using a DEX aggregator like <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a>.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">earn interest</a> by lending out your DAI on other DeFi lending protocols. Remember to keep in mind the stability fees you&#8217;ll owe on any DAI you generate or borrow from your Vault. And also, consider the various risks involved in lending some of which we cover in our <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/zero-to-defi-cdai/">Zero to DeFi</a> guide.</p>



<p>Another way to earn interest is to deposit DAI into Maker&#8217;s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dsr-dai-savings-rate/">Dai Savings Rate</a> (DSR). The DSR allows users to lock in DAI to earn a variable interest rate. However, don&#8217;t go generating DAI just to deposit it into the DSR because the DSR is designed to be lower than the stability fee. <a href="https://oasis.app/save">Learn more</a> about the Dai Savings Rate.</p>



<p>You&#8217;d be surprised the many interesting ways you can use your DAI! Explore <a href="https://github.com/makerdao/awesome-makerdao#dai-1">a full list of ecosystem resources</a> composed by the Maker community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2020 is set to be an exciting year for DeFi. Lending markets are more competitive than ever. Countless layer 2 solutions are being built with new ZK technology. And to top it off, this year we&#8217;re likely to see interoperability make great strides. Let&#8217;s dive into a few DApps who have hit the ground running this year.</p>
<h3>Maker</h3>
<p>Fresh off the successful launch of Multi-Collateral Dai, <a href="https://makerdao.com/">Maker</a> has been solidifying its #1 position on the <a href="https://defipulse.com/">DeFi Pulse</a> rankings headed into 2020. As of writing this, there&#8217;s <a href="https://defipulse.com/maker">over 36M DAI locked</a> in MakerDAO, primarily in the Dai Savings Rate. And now, MakerDAO voted to increase the <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dsr-dai-savings-rate/">Dai Savings Rate</a> (<a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dsr-dai-savings-rate/">DSR</a>) to 6%. It&#8217;s no wonder the total DAI locked in DeFi is setting a new all-time high.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-7878" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Selection_898.png" alt="" width="895" height="311" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Selection_898.png 895w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Selection_898-300x104.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Selection_898-768x267.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /></h3>
<p>To add fuel to the fire, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-chai/">CHAI</a> is a smart contract that wraps DAI in the DSR so DeFi users can have their cake and eat it too. Chai can also be used in smart contracts. For example, Fulcrum&#8217;s iDAI now supports CHAI so any idle DAI earns the DSR.</p>
<h3>Chainlink</h3>
<p><a href="https://chain.link/">Chainlink</a>&#8216;s following extends beyond the LINK Army you&#8217;ve likely come across on social media to partnerships big and small, including Intel and Google Cloud services.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7870" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENr_U9sU0AYf_rX.jpeg" alt="chainlink" width="525" height="452" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENr_U9sU0AYf_rX.jpeg 958w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENr_U9sU0AYf_rX-300x258.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENr_U9sU0AYf_rX-768x661.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>
<p>Just take a look at this smorgasbord of Chainlink partnerships and the network effects of the project seem undeniable. Synthetix&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.synthetix.io/chainlink-decentralizes-first-wave-of-synthetix-price-feeds/">recent integration of Chainlink oracles</a> to its FX/commodities markets is a primary example of a fruitful partnership to keep an eye in 2020. Another example would be <a href="https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/chainlink-and-loopring-collaborate-on-oracles-for-zkrollup-dex-protocol-c1c8094afc27">Loopring&#8217;s work with Chainlink</a> to ensure its economic security. We&#8217;ll discuss this more in a bit.</p>
<p>Not to mention, Aave Protocol just launched its lending protocol with all 16 of its supported assets powered by Chainlink oracles.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">1/<a href="https://twitter.com/AaveAave?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AaveAave</a> ( <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24LEND&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$LEND</a>) launched its lending protocol today with a bang!<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4a5.png" alt="💥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Here&#39;s a TLDR:</p>
<p>&quot;flash loans enable a .. smart contract to borrow assets from our reserve pools within one transaction on the condition that the liquidity is returned to the pool before the transaction ends&quot; <a href="https://t.co/YiVYLnBX3X">https://t.co/YiVYLnBX3X</a></p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<h3>Loopring</h3>
<p>Following Ethereum&#8217;s Istanbul upgrade, <a href="https://loopring.org/#/">Loopring</a>&#8216;s ZK tech has been given a <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-ethereums-istanbul-network-upgrade-affects-defi/">performance boost by EIP-2028</a>. WeDEX launched their beta in December as the first ZK Rollup DEX built with Loopring v3. Test results <a href="https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/loopring-testing-phase-1-data-recap-ed0c67396870">released this week</a> revealed that the &#8220;average settlement cost per trade [on WeDEX was] about 5,000 gas, or 0.0000177 ETH.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/loopringorg/status/1214278030308335616"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7885" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENn7bTfWoAI6VCm-1024x420.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="263" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENn7bTfWoAI6VCm-1024x420.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENn7bTfWoAI6VCm-300x123.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENn7bTfWoAI6VCm-768x315.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENn7bTfWoAI6VCm-1536x630.jpeg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENn7bTfWoAI6VCm-2048x840.jpeg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ENn7bTfWoAI6VCm-1568x643.jpeg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a></p>
<p>Additionally, Loopring&#8217;s recent decision to integrate Chainlink seems like a promising sign for the platform&#8217;s future. Long story short, the Loopring Protocol requires users to stake LRC tokens for a number of reasons. Particularly, zkRollup DEX owners stake LRC in order to process layer 2 trades and submit them to Ethereum. Chainlink will help Loopring scale off-chain functions and ensure the protocol&#8217;s economic security by providing a reliable decentralized price oracle for LRC/ETH. <a href="https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/chainlink-and-loopring-collaborate-on-oracles-for-zkrollup-dex-protocol-c1c8094afc27">Read more</a> about Loopring&#8217;s Chainlink integration.</p>

<p>No, we&#8217;re not talking about the beverage. We&#8217;re talking about this new token creating buzz in the Ethereum community lately called Chai. CHAI is an ERC20 token that&#8217;s like DAI which earns interest from Maker&#8217;s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dsr-dai-savings-rate/">Dai Savings Rate</a> (DSR), currently 4% as of writing this. It&#8217;s a lot like how <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-cdai/">cDAI</a> represents DAI supplied to Compound plus interest. Chai.sol, the token&#8217;s smart contact, deposits your DAI into the DSR and issues you CHAI tokens which can be stored, transferred, traded, and later redeemed for the underlying DAI plus any interest earned. As an added bonus, it&#8217;s also supports gas-less token transfers.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/dapphub/chai">project</a>, smart contract, and interface was created by Martin Lundfall, Lucas Vogelsang, and Lev Livnev. Also, Abbey Titcomb made the lovely mug pixel art. Deployed on December 1st, 2019, you can now pay friends, grow your savings, trade, etc. while still earning interest on your DAI.</p>

<h3>How do I get Chai tokens?</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s super easy to start earning interest, playfully named &#8220;brewing your DAI!&#8221; Just perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to this handy Chai <a href="https://chai.money/">interface</a></li>
<li>Connect your wallet</li>
<li>Enter amount of DAI you&#8217;d like to convert</li>
<li>Click the Convert button and the prompts to confirm transaction</li>
</ol>
<p>And when you&#8217;re ready to stop &#8220;brewing&#8221; and cash out, flip over to the CHAI -&gt; DAI tab and redeem tokens for your DAI plus interest.</p>
<h2>Money Legos in action</h2>
<p>The awesome part thing about DeFi is that smart contracts like Legos can be pieced together in many different ways to create new utility. Similar to cDAI, Chai takes DAI that would normally be locked away and turns them into useful liquid assets. And, it isn&#8217;t the only one to take advantage of Maker&#8217;s Dai Savings Rate contract and it won&#8217;t be the last. For example, there&#8217;s also <a href="https://medium.com/@keydonix/dai-hrd-token-hold-rated-dai-dfd3fe491d83?">DAI-HRD</a> which similarly wraps DAI into the DSR. Another prime example of a project adding utility to DAI is <a href="https://rdai.money/">rDAI</a> which let&#8217;s you redirect the interest generated from your DAI on multiple DeFi platforms. Nothing stops someone from making an interest bearing meta-stablecoin by combining cDAI, Chai, and/or cUSD, etc. The only limit is the imagination of developers in the DeFi community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t panic. Everything is ok. The Maker system has been upgraded to Multi-Collateral Dai. You should see SAI in your wallet instead of DAI. This just means it&#8217;s time to migrate your &#8220;DAI&#8221;, now referred to as SAI, to Maker&#8217;s new architecture.</p>
<p>With the launch of Multi-Collateral Dai on November 18th, 2019, the name and ticker symbol of Single Collateral Dai is changing to Sai (SAI). DAI now refers to DAI minted in the new Multi-Collateral Dai system. The term Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) is also being replaced with the term &#8220;Vault&#8221; under MCDai.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7776" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-1024x496.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="310" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-1024x496.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-300x145.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-768x372.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-1536x744.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-1568x760.jpg 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h3>
<p>These changes were made to reduce confusion during the transition period where both the Single Collateral and Multi-Collateral Maker systems will run in parallel. During this time, DAI and SAI will exist in the market together.</p>
<p>Each smart contract, platform, or service that previously used DAI is expected to change ticker symbols and upgrade accordingly. And while many services and exchanges plan to transition ASAP, the process isn&#8217;t going to be instant. Be careful not to confuse the two tokens and double-check before sending tokens anywhere. Mistakes may result in the loss of your funds.</p>
<h3>What changes are coming with Multi-Collateral Dai?</h3>
<p>As the name implies, Dai will now be backed by multiple assets instead of just Ethereum (ETH). At launch, the MCD system will support ETH and BAT tokens.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MakerDAO community will continue to assess and integrate new collateral types moving forward as part of the governance process. The following tokens are also being considered: Augur (REP), DigixDAO (DGD), Golem (GNT), OmiseGo (OMG), 0x (ZRX).</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dsr-dai-savings-rate/">Dai Savings Rate</a> (DSR) feature will give users the option to lock their DAI into Maker’s DAI Savings Rate contract and earn a variable interest rate in DAI.</p>
<p>One last small change is that the stability fee for borrowing DAI or &#8220;opening a Vault position&#8221; will now be owed in DAI instead of Maker (MKR).</p>
<h3>How do I migrate my SAI to DAI?</h3>
<p><strong>Be sure to only attempt to migrate Sai from a wallet where you control the private keys.</strong> If you do not control the keys to the wallet where your SAI is stored (like a centralized exchange or locked in a DApp), either withdraw your SAI to your own wallet or follow their instructions for how to migrate to DAI.</p>
<h4>To migrate your SAI to DAI:</h4>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://migrate.makerdao.com/">migrate.makerdao.com</a></li>
<li>Login with your wallet</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Continue&#8221; on the &#8220;Single Collateral Dai redeemer&#8221; tab</li>
<li>Enter the amount of SAI to upgrade</li>
<li>Submit your transaction</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>DONE! You should receive your Dai in your wallet momentarily.</p>
<h3>What should I do if&#8230;</h3>
<h4>I have a CDP open</h4>
<p>You have two options: migrate using Maker&#8217;s <a href="https://migrate.makerdao.com/">Migration App</a> or manually close your CDP. Using the Migration App requires you to pay back any stability fees owed in MKR at the time before migrating to a MCDai Vault.</p>
<h4>I use Compound Finance or hold cDAI</h4>
<p>Compound <a href="https://medium.com/compound-finance/support-for-multi-collateral-dai-c8691d0ef794">has stated</a> that existing SAI markets will continue to function as normal with no changes. &#8220;You are individually responsible for choosing when, and how, to migrate to Multi-Collateral DAI.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once ready, new DAI will be added to Compound and both markets will be accessible for the foreseeable future. Interest rates for both assets may be volatile during this time. cDAI users can withdraw their SAI and manually migrate to DAI at anytime.</p>
<p>Compound borrowers have the option to pay back their SAI debts and open new positions when DAI is ready. Alternatively, you can read on to learn how to migrate your Compound positions via InstaDApp</p>
<h4>I use InstaDApp</h4>
<p>InstaDApp is launching the <a href="https://medium.com/instadapp/mcd-migration-70782c9e6730">InstaDApp Migration Bridge</a> which allows Compound users to convert their SAI debt to DAI debt in one transaction. Although most users&#8217; debt positions are small enough, migration is subject to how SAI liquidity is available at the time.</p>
<h4>I use dYdX</h4>
<p>At launch, dYdX&#8217;s SAI markets will remain unchanged. dYdX <a href="https://medium.com/dydxderivatives/multi-collateral-dai-migration-on-dydx-e130575c4454">announced</a> that 2–3 weeks after DAI launches any remaining SAI balances, positions, and open orders will be converted to DAI automatically. Although, you can always close your positions, withdraw your SAI, and migrate manually at any time.</p>
<h4>I use Nuo Network</h4>
<p>Nuo <a href="https://medium.com/nuo-news/nuo-action-plan-for-multi-collateral-dai-a1aaa75142af">said that</a> it will rename DAI to SAI and all SAI loans, trades, and reserves will continue to exist. Nuo plans to provide a gas-free way to convert all positions by November 25th. Users may choose to either continue with existing SAI positions or convert them into DAI seamlessly on Nuo.</p>
<h4>I use Fulcrum or Torque Loans</h4>
<p>bZx Network&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/bzxnetwork/mcd-transition-plan-f2abd3176b09">transition plan</a> has you covered. Lenders on Fulcrum do not have to do anything immediately but can migrate via Fulcrum in a press of a button. SAI markets will continue to function normally and a new DAI lending pool will be launched. Torque borrowers will to continue to pay their SAI loans in SAI.</p>
<p>Fulcrum traders&#8217; SAI positions &#8220;will continue operating for as long as there is lending and exchange liquidity. If we see that the volume of the positions is coming close to exceeding what exchange liquidity for SAI can support, the positions will cease being perpetual and expire on their next rollover date.&#8221;</p>
<h3>How are exchanges handling the transition?</h3>
<p>Each exchange will handle the transition differently. We recommend you do your own research or simply withdraw your SAI and migrate it yourself. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/single-collateral-dai-to-multi-collateral-dai-upgrade-timeline-and-actions/">a timeline</a> created by Maker documenting the upgrade and confirmed exchanges.</p>
<p>MCDai will be available to trade on Oasis Trade immediately upon its launch November 18th. Uniswap, Bamboo Relay, and Kyber Network will support both SAI and DAI trading as soon as possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> renamed DAI to &#8220;SAI old DAI (DAI)&#8221; in its menus. On Monday Nov. 18th, MCD DAI will be listed as DAI and ready to trade, sourcing liquidity from all available DEXes.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-and-coinbase-pro-plan-to-support-multi-collateral-dai-514407679b86">Coinbase and Coinbase Pro</a> plan to automatically convert any SAI you hold on Coinbase to multi-collateral DAI on December 2nd at 9 AM PST (you can get a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/daley_e6">Coinbase account here</a> if you don&#8217;t have one).</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Introducing Interest Per Year, or IPY for short, a new metric created by DeFi Pulse used to track the performance...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Introducing <a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">Interest Per Year</a>, or IPY for short, a new metric created by DeFi Pulse used to track the performance of DeFi lending markets.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine IPY like the speedometer for DeFi measuring the speed at which interest is accruing in DeFi lending protocols given the borrow rate and outstanding debt at that moment. IPY is useful for measuring the potential performance changes of lending protocols in the short term.</span></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s truly fascinating about a metric like IPY is the fact that it isn&#8217;t possible without DeFi.</strong> In centralized finance, banks, financial institutions, and regulators control the flow of information. These authorities choose what information gets disclosed to the public. It&#8217;s not like you can walk into your bank and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m here to perform an audit.&#8221; But things are different with DeFi.</p>
<p>With DeFi, all the data is publicly available on-chain for everyone to see. Transparency and real time data are two major&nbsp;advantages DeFi has gained by rebuilding things from scratch. And it&#8217;s up to us as members of the DeFi community to decide how we want to synthesize the data and utilize those advantages.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7742 size-full" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1.jpg" alt="" width="895" height="645" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1.jpg 895w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1-300x216.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1-768x553.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that DeFi lending is still maturing. Historically, the most popular form of collateral has been ETH. And, the most popular asset to borrow has been DAI. Lending rates have been highly correlated to the performance of this trading pair ETH/DAI. While rates may go up and down, outstanding debts have consistently risen over time. Additionally, as DeFi lending matures and new assets like securities, property, real estate, etc enter the picture, metrics like IPY will mature as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7745 size-full" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="815" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326-300x272.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326-768x695.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>Interest Per Year is an example of what&#8217;s possible through DeFi. It&#8217;s a metric that can help market participants better understand the condition of DeFi lending markets.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, DAI&#8217;s IPY is generally greater than USDC&#8217;s but USDC has a more stable IPY. This indicates that there is greater demand for DAI loans overall but USDC is carving out a niche for steady consistent lending returns.</span></p>
<p>Whether you want to analyze historical rates or simply stay ahead of trends in DeFi, the new&nbsp;<a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">DeFi Lending</a>&nbsp;page makes it easier to spot patterns emerging in the market.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our new page supports a variety of assets including DAI, USDC, ETH, REP, ZRX, WBTC, and BAT with lending data from Compound, Maker, dYdX, and Fulcrum.</span></p>
<h3>Witness the growth of DeFi lending markets firsthand</h3>
<p>Decentralized Finance is still in its infancy. It&#8217;s a historic time for the industry and we&#8217;re about to witness events which will shape DeFi forever. In the days ahead, we&#8217;ll see more and more assets be introduced as collateral in DeFi. Not to mention, different lending models will emerge. And on top of it all, more and more people will experience borrowing or lending in DeFi for the first time. We hope <a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">DeFi Lending</a> will give you the tools to capture history in the making.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a question or feedback about the new Lending page? Let us know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/defipulse">Twitter</a> or in our&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/y7qSf4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord.</a></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Maker Foundation <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/breaking-launch-date-of-multi-collateral-dai-announced-at-devcon-5/">announced at Devcon5</a> that Multi-Collateral Dai is coming November 18th, 2019. This means that you will soon have the opportunity to earn interest with your DAI. It&#8217;s all thanks to a new feature coming with Multi-Collateral Dai called the Dai Savings Rate, or DSR for short.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_7672" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7672" style="width: 375px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7672" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/new-dai-layered-1024x1024.png" alt="Dai Savings Rate (DSR)" width="375" height="375" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/new-dai-layered-1024x1024.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/new-dai-layered-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/new-dai-layered-150x150.png 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/new-dai-layered-768x768.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/new-dai-layered-1536x1536.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/new-dai-layered-1568x1568.png 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/new-dai-layered.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-7672" class="wp-caption-text">DAI&#8217;s new symbol</figcaption></figure></p>
<h3>What is the Dai Savings Rate (DSR)?</h3>
<p>The Dai Savings Rate is a mechanism for the MakerDAO to control the demand side of the supply and demand equation by offering an interest rate for locking in some of the total DAI supply. Up until this point, MakerDAO only had the ability to directly affect the supply of DAI through the stability fee it charges <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-cdp/">CDP</a> holders.</p>
<h4>How does it work?</h4>
<p>Once live, DAI token holders will have the option to lock their DAI into Maker&#8217;s DAI Savings Rate contract and earn a variable interest rate in DAI. The DAI necessary to pay the DSR contract is taken from the stability fee pool. If the pool ever runs dry, the Maker contract prints new MKR to cover the debt. Ultimately, it&#8217;s up to MKR holders to properly govern the rate and ensure the system runs smoothly.</p>
<p>A<a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/an-update-on-the-dai-savings-rate-in-multi-collateral-dai/"> recent DSR update</a> discussed some of the challenges in governing this new component of the MakerDAO system.</p>
<h4>How much will I make for locking in my DAI?</h4>
<p>The rate is not set in stone like the stability fee its controlled by MakerDAO token holders. However, we can assume that the DSR can never be greater than the stability fee. And, the <a href="https://mkr.tools/governance/stabilityfee">current stability fee</a> is 10.5% (subject to change with MCDai). We can also look towards existing secondary lending markets which currently <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">offer around 8% APY</a> to get an idea of what would be competitive.</p>
<p><strong>MKR Holders, don&#8217;t forget to <a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/polling">vote for MCDai on November 15th</a>.</strong> Stay tuned for more details about Multi-Collateral Dai and how to start earning with the DSR!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you keep hearing about Ethereum and DeFi from a co-worker, family member, or friend and want to learn more. It&#8217;s no wonder everyone is talking about DeFi, or rather decentralized finance, when it&#8217;s the fastest growing sector of finance. DeFi applications built on the Ethereum blockchain currently in control of $500 million worth of digital assets. And on top of that, users have historically earned 5-20% interest in DeFi lending platforms. But we&#8217;re getting ahead of ourselves&#8230;</p>
<p>With so much information out there, it can be hard to make heads or tails of where to begin. So we&#8217;ve put together this guide to help you along as you take your first steps into the exciting new world of Ethereum and decentralized finance, aka DeFi. And by the end of this guide, you&#8217;ll be able to see your money grow every few seconds with a yearly interest higher than any bank will ever offer you. So let&#8217;s get started putting your money to work for you.</p>
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<h4>What is cryptocurrency?</h4>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a new form of digital asset created, maintained, and secured by a decentralized network of participants. A type of distributed ledger called a  blockchain is most commonly used to securely store and distribute cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>A blockchain is a system for maintaining a shared ledger among a network of computers around the world called nodes. The ledger stores the entire history of a cryptocurrency and every transaction that has occurred in its history. Each node keeps a copy of the ledger to verify account balances and transactions for themselves.</p>
<p>Transactions on the blockchain are processed by miners. Miners take pending transactions submitted to the network and organize them into a small blocks of data. These blocks of transactions form a chain as new ones are added thus the name blockchain.</p>
<p>Miners compete for which block should be appended to the chain by solving a math puzzles in a process called mining. The miner who solves a block first gets to collect all the transaction fees paid within that block and is given issued newly minted cryptocurrency as a reward. This reward is called a block reward.</p>
<p>Mining distributes new cryptocurrency as well as secures the network. Mining requires a lot of energy and resources. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates an incentive for miners to continue producing blocks in an honest manner. Due to the fact each block is created based on the previous one, it becomes more and more difficult for someone to try and trick the rest of the network. </span>This concept of using computational power and incentives to secure the network is called Proof of Work.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an attacker wanted to change the history stored in the blockchain, they would need to have a majority of the total mining power or hashrate of a cryptocurrency network. In other words, a network remains secure as long as no one miner controls 51% of the mining power, also known as a 51% attack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even if they did, maintaining this type of attack quickly becomes infeasible due to its costs. The idea is that the reward for mining valid blocks outweighs what a bad actor stands to gain by performing a 51% attack. </span></p>
<h4>What is a wallet?</h4>
<p>A wallet is a software application used to send and store cryptocurrency as well as interact with any applications built on that blockchain.</p>
<p>A wallet can be roughly compared to your bank account; it stores your assets and it has an &#8220;account number&#8221; or address. Some wallets allow you to generate multiple public addresses. Only your assets are store securely on the blockchain instead of in the custody of your bank.</p>
<p>Wallets have no registration or sign-up process. There are two parts to generating and accessing your wallet. Wallets are generated with a 12 or 24 word phrase called your seed words. Other common names are seed phrase, recovery phrase, and mnemonic phrase. With this phrase, you can recover or restore your wallet from anywhere.</p>
<p>When you generate your wallet, you&#8217;ll be asked to set a password or pin which is required to login in or access your wallet. Do not forget this password otherwise you will be locked out of your wallet. And, the only way to &#8220;reset&#8221; the password is to recover the wallet again with your seed phrase.</p>
<h4>Why is my seed phrase so important?</h4>
<p>As previously mentioned, your seed phrase is what you use to restore your wallet. In the case where your wallet is inaccessible, lost, or destroyed, you&#8217;ll need this phrase to recover your wallet and the cryptocurrency it holds.</p>
<p>If you lose your seed phrase and no longer can access your wallet, your funds could potentially be lost forever. This is why backing up your seed phrase is so important.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to keep in mind that <em>anyone</em> with your seed phrase can recover your wallets and take the funds inside. So be very careful where you store them and who may have access to them. Many people store their seed phrase in their safe or a safety deposit box. Don&#8217;t store them in a Google Doc where almost anyone can stumble on them.</p>
<h4>How do I keep my cryptocurrency safe from hack or theft?</h4>
<p>Generally, to keep yourself safe from hackers or thieves online you&#8217;ll need to follow best practices when it comes to cybersecurity and privacy. Things like keeping your PC clear of viruses or malware, using secure passwords (maybe even a password manager), securing your network properly, enable app-based 2FA like Authy or Google Authenticator wherever possible, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot cover all of cybersecurity in this guide because it is far too vast of a topic. However, here&#8217;s some resources that can help you learn the best practices for keeping yourself safe online and offline.</p>

<h4><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7591 alignleft" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/1200px-Ethereum_logo_2014.svg_-1-150x150.png" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></h4>
<h4>What is Ethereum? What is ether (ETH)?</h4>
<p>Ethereum is the world’s leading programmable blockchain. Ether (ETH) is the Ethereum network&#8217;s native cryptocurrency. All transactions on the Ethereum network require transaction fees paid in ETH called gas.</p>
<h4>What is a smart contract? What are tokens?</h4>
<p>Smart contracts are what make ETH programmable money. Smart contracts are  applications or scripts programmed to run on the Ethereum network capable of creating and managing digital assets. You can build complex irreversible agreements without the need for a middle man.</p>
<p>These applications are called DApps, or decentralized applications. Smart contracts have many use cases including financial products (borrowing, lending, trading, payments), games, collectibles, and much much more.</p>
<p>Smart contracts allow you to create digital assets called tokens. Tokens represent many types of digital assets such as currencies, tokenized physical assets like gold, a share of ownership in a DApp, etc.</p>
<h4>What is DeFi?</h4>
<p>Decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, is what the Ethereum community calls financial smart contracts, decentralized applications (DApps), and protocols built on Ethereum. Popular DeFi products include decentralized exchanges, lending and borrowing markets, tokenized physical assets such as gold, derivatives, prediction / betting markets, payment networks, insurance, etc.</p>
<h4><b>What is a decentralized exchange?</b></h4>
<p>A decentralized exchange, or DEX for short, is like a stock exchange run by a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Although both allow you to trade assets, a decentralized exchange trades cryptocurrency only and so does not require a centralized authority to operate.</p>
<p>DEXes are perfect for trading ETH or tokens on the blockchain without having to rely on a centralized authority like a traditional cryptocurrency exchange. Trading on a DEX reduces some risk because you keep your ETH and tokens in your wallet instead of placing them in someone else&#8217;s control. Trades are made by transacting with the DEX&#8217;s underlying smart contract and the only time your funds leave your account is to execute a trade.</p>
<h4><b><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-7587 alignnone" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/maker-logo-1024x288.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="180" /></b></h4>
<h4><b>What is DAI and MakerDAO?</b></h4>
<p>MakerDAO is a smart contract that let&#8217;s users open Collateralized Debt Positions, or CDPs for short. Users deposit ETH as collateral and are able to mint/borrow a token called DAI. DAI is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.</p>
<p>Borrowers pay an annual interest rate called the stability fee for the opportunity to mint new DAI. And when the debt is repaid, the DAI is burned along with the stability fee owed in Maker&#8217;s token MKR. The stability fee deters users from over-inflating the total supply of DAI.</p>
<p>CDP holders are required to have a minimum of 150% collateral to outstanding debt. For every 1 DAI, there is at least $1.50 worth of Ether (ETH) locked into a Maker CDP as collateral. And if their collateral value falls, the CDP holder must lock in more ETH, pay back some of their debt, or risk having their position liquidated. When a CDP is liquidated, the ETH held as collateral is automatically sold to pay back the debts in addition to penalty fee for falling before a ratio of 150%.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, Maker has its own token called MKR which is used to pay for the stability fee on outstanding debts. Maker (MKR)&#8217;s primary function is to act as a voting share in the MakerDAO system. MKR holders vote on changes and issues that affect how Maker&#8217;s underlying smart contract operates. As MKR burns with each debt repaid, the idea is that MKR&#8217;s value will increase if it is governed well.</p>
<p>MakerDAO is sort of like a central bank in the sense it issues DAI in charge of keeping DAI stable at ~$1. If the DAI supply increases too much and DAI&#8217;s value falls below $1, the stability fee is increased to encourage CDP holders to pay back their debts.</p>
<p>Here is where it is important for us to mention that you don&#8217;t have to open a CDP to own DAI. You can simply purchase DAI off of the open market from someone else who opened a CDP. Whoever you bought the DAI from still owes the debt and their collateral remains locked in MakerDAO until the debt is paid. It&#8217;s a lot like how the US dollar used to be back by gold.</p>
<p>DAI is like a smart version of the US Dollar. While the price of ETH may fluctuate, you can count on DAI to hover around $1. So there&#8217;s a natural demand for DAI because its programability combined with its stability makes it perfect for payments, commerce, games, loans, and many many more use cases and DApps.</p>
<p><b><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7586 alignnone" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/compound-logo-1-1024x248.png" alt="" width="500" height="121" /></b></p>
<p><b>What is Compound? What is cDAI? Why am I earning interest?</b></p>
<p>Compound is a smart contract that allows users to borrow and lend tokens. Similar to your bank, Compound lends out your money to borrowers and earn interest over time. But unlike your bank, your interest begins compounding the minute you deposit into Compound&#8217;s smart contract. And since it&#8217;s a smart contract, the rate you earn is higher than traditional banks because there&#8217;s no middleman.</p>
<p>Similar to MakerDAO, loans are secured through over-collateralization. Borrowers deposit tokens into Compound to increase their &#8220;borrowing power.&#8221; If the borrower&#8217;s borrowing power falls below 0, their collateral is sold to cover the debt. The interest rates on loans is different for each asset and vary based on the demand for that asset.</p>
<p>On the flip side, lenders earn variable passive interest for supplying tokens to Compound&#8217;s money market. Stablecoins like DAI are arguably the most popular asset to borrow and earn fairly high return rates (historically 5 &#8211; 20% APR) for lenders. When you deposit DAI, you&#8217;re given cDAI tokens in return to represent your deposit and the interest it accrues. This is true for any token or asset deposited into Compound and these tokens are called cTokens.</p>
<p>The exchange rate originally began at 50 cDAI for every one 1 DAI, and as interest accrues in the market, each cDAI will be worth more DAI. The idea is that as your interest accrues, you’ll need less cTokens to redeem your original DAI. In other words, the exchange rate between Dai and cDai grows proportionally with the interest rate.</p>
<p>So by simply owning and holding onto cDAI tokens, you&#8217;re earning passive income in decentralized finance.</p>
<h4>What are the risks involved?</h4>
<p>See the Risks and Considerations section below.</p>
<h1>Earn passive income by lending on Compound</h1>
<h2>1. <b>Create Coinbase account</b></h2>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/daley_e6">Coinbase</a>. Follow the account creation process and be sure to use your real name as it appears on your passport or government ID. Also, make sure you use a <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">secure password</a> and email (account recovery is like a backdoor to your account, be sure that door is locked).</p>
<p>Once your information is submitted, you&#8217;ll be required to verify your email. If you don&#8217;t receive the verification email, check your spam folder just in case before resending it. Click the &#8216;Verify Email Address&#8217; button found in your verification email from Coinbase.</p>
<h3>Setup your account</h3>
<p>Now we can setup your Coinbase account by verifying your identity, adding a payment method for later, and securing your account with app-based 2FA.</p>
<h4>Verifying your identity</h4>
<p>First, it&#8217;s going to have you confirm your phone number by sending you a code via SMS. Enter this code to verify your phone number.</p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll be prompted to verify your identity with either your passport, driver&#8217;s license, or some other form of photo ID. This is required for Coinbase to comply with regulators. It also benefits you with higher purchasing limits and in the case you get locked out of your account and they can verify it&#8217;s actually you.</p>
<p>Select the form of ID and follow the prompts to activate your webcam or phone camera. It&#8217;ll have you take a picture of both the front and the back. If the image looks clear, click the &#8216;Finish &amp; start verification&#8217; button.</p>
<p>Coinbase will then review your documents. This process may take a few days.</p>
<h4>Link your bank account to your Coinbase account</h4>
<p>Head to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/settings/linked-accounts">Linked Accounts</a> under your Coinbase account settings, click &#8216;Link a New Account&#8217; and select &#8216;Bank Account&#8217;. Follow the Plaid prompts to access your banking information. If Plaid is unsuccessful, you may need to manually enter your banking information.</p>
<p>Coinbase may use a charge verification to verify your banking details. A charge verification is when Coinbase places two random charges like $1.37 and $1.61 to your account. They ask you to enter the precise amounts they charged by checking your bank statement. Once confirmed, the charges are removed.</p>
<h4>Enabling 2FA</h4>
<p>You&#8217;re likely familiar with <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication">2 form authentication (2FA)</a> or 2-step verification. You&#8217;ve likely come across a time where you need 6 digit code from sent to you via SMS to log into an account. And while this is technically 2FA, it&#8217;s not great and can actually leave you vulnerable if anyone were to get a hold of your phone. This type of attack referred to as a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/">SIM swapping</a>, SIM porting, or SIMjacking is common in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll show you how to use authenticator apps like Google Authenticator (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a> / <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://authy.com/download/">Authy</a> to secure your Coinbase account instead. Go ahead and install one of these apps onto your phone. Then under your Coinbase account <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/settings/security_settings">security settings</a> &gt; 2-step verification section, select Authenticator. A QR code will be shown on screen. You&#8217;ll take your authenticator app, click the &#8216;+&#8217; button, and scan the QR code.</p>
<p>This QR code is the secret that your app will use to generate new 6 digit one-time codes every 30 seconds or so. The secret is stored locally on your device meaning if you lose your phone you won&#8217;t be able to access these one-time codes. The idea is that without that device an attacker couldn&#8217;t access your account with your login information alone. But, this means that if you lose access to it, neither will you.</p>
<p>On Coinbase, you need to enter these one-time codes to login and perform many of the functions of the service. 2FA can be reset in an absolute emergency but it can take days if not weeks of working with customer service to verify your identity.</p>
<p>We recommend you securely back up this secret somehow BEFORE entering the one-time code to enable 2FA on your Coinbase account, in case of an emergency. Some people print it out and store it in a safe location. Or, you can use another device you own to scan the QR code as well so you have it in two places. You can even allow a trusted family member, friend, or spouse to scan it and store a copy of the secret for you.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t back up your 2FA secret but still have access to your authenticator, you can disable and re-enable 2FA to generate a new secret which can be backed up.</p>

<h2>2. <b>Install MetaMask and setup your Ethereum wallet</b></h2>
<p>MetaMask is a web extension that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and manages the private keys to your Ethereum wallet in-browser.</p>
<p><a href="https://metamask.io/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7584" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_144-1-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="341" /></a></p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask.io</a> and click the orange &#8216;Get Extension&#8217; button This will take you the extension for your browser.  Click the &#8216;Add to Browser&#8217; and &#8216;add&#8217; if a popup appears to install the MetaMask extension to your browser.</p>
<h4>Setting up your MetaMask account / Ethereum wallet</h4>
<p>Once installed, you should see a little orange fox icon to the right of your browser&#8217;s address bar. Click this fox icon and then the &#8216;Continue&#8217; button to begin setting up your account.</p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll be prompted for a password for your MetaMask account. Make sure this is a secure password and<strong> do not forget it</strong>. This password is used to encrypt the private keys to your Ethereum wallet file stored locally on your computer. MetaMask will prompt you for this password each time you access the extension. It&#8217;s never a bad idea to write down this password and store in a safe place.</p>
<p>Click &#8216;create&#8217; once you&#8217;ve entered your password. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms of use.</p>
<p>Finally, click the shaded area to reveal your seed phrase. As you may recall, this seed phrase is extremely important because it&#8217;s what allows you to access or recover your wallet if you weren&#8217;t able to remember your password or your MetaMask were to become inaccessible. BACK IT UP and store it in a secure location. If you forget your seed phrase, there is no way to recover any funds stored in the wallets generated by that seed phrase.</p>
<p>Click next after you&#8217;ve created a back up or multiple back ups of your seed phrase. MetaMask then tests if you actually backed it up by making you click each word of your seed phrase in order. Press the &#8216;confirm&#8217; button once you are finished.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you&#8217;ve created your first Ethereum wallet.</p>
<h2>3. <b>Deposit USD/EUR into Coinbase Account</b></h2>
<p>Login to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/daley_e6">Coinbase</a>, if you weren&#8217;t already, and navigate to &#8216;<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/accounts/">Accounts</a>&#8216;. Here you should see the currency wallets available to your account. Under the currency of your choice (USD or EUR Wallet), click the deposit button.</p>
<h4>Bank deposit</h4>
<p>You can choose to either deposit from your bank account and wait a few days. Just enter the amount to deposit and hit confirm. Your funds are &#8216;on hold&#8217; while the bank transfer is cleared with your bank. This can take up to 3 &#8211; 7 days depending on your bank.</p>
<h4>Wire transfer</h4>
<p>Or, you can choose to send your money with a Wire Transfer but it&#8217;ll cost you a $10 wire fee. Bank wire transfers may be credited to your Coinbase account on the same day if submitted by 1:00 PM PT. Otherwise, funds will be available after one business day.</p>
<h2><b>4. Transfer to Coinbase Pro</b></h2>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/">Coinbase Pro</a>, a cryptocurrency exchange run by Coinbase, and login in using your Coinbase login information. These accounts are linked by default and so share the same login.</p>
<p>Once logged in, click the &#8216;My Wallets&#8217; button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Then, click &#8216;Deposit&#8217; which will popup a menu where you&#8217;ll select your US Dollar or Euros.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7618 size-full" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_164.jpg" alt="" width="703" height="599" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_164.jpg 703w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_164-300x256.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px" /></p>
<p>Select the &#8216;Coinbase Account&#8217; option on the right side. Enter the amount you&#8217;d like to deposit or simply hit &#8216;Max&#8217; and then click the &#8216;Deposit&#8217; button at the bottom of the window. Your funds should transfer instantly unless they are still on hold.</p>
<h2>5. <b>Convert USD/EUR to DAI</b></h2>
<h4>Purchasing ETH</h4>
<p>Follow the link for your currency (<a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/ETH-USD">USD</a> or <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/ETH-EUR">EUR</a>). On the left side of the page you should see your Wallet Balance and below that Order Form.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting here that cryptocurrencies like ETH are relatively new and their value can be quite volatile. <strong>Never invest more than you are willing to lose!</strong></p>
<p>Select &#8216;Buy&#8217;, &#8216;Market&#8217;, and enter the amount of money you&#8217;d like to spend or &#8216;Max&#8217;. Verify the details of your trade and click &#8216;Place Buy Order.&#8217; You&#8217;re now the proud owner of Ether (ETH).</p>
<h4>Withdrawing your ETH to MetaMask</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s withdraw your ETH to your MetaMask wallet. Under &#8216;Wallet Balance&#8217; on the left side, click the &#8216;Withdraw&#8217; button. Select &#8216;Ether&#8217; in the popup window. Now, click the MetaMask icon at the top of your browser window to open up MetaMask&#8217;s menu. Above your wallet balance and the Ether symbol, you should see your &#8216;Account #&#8217; and part of your wallet address.</p>
<p>If you hover over this and click it, it will copy your wallet address to your clipboard. Paste this into &#8216;Destination&#8217; field in the Coinbase Pro Withdraw ETH popup window. Be sure to double check the address because Ethereum transactions are irreversible and you cannot retrieve funds sent to an address you don&#8217;t own.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve verified the address, enter the amount of ETH to withdraw and click &#8216;Withdraw ETH&#8217; button. You&#8217;ll be prompted to enter the 6 digits from your 2FA app. After you&#8217;re finished, your funds will be sent from Coinbase to your MetaMask wallet momentarily.</p>
<h4>Swap ETH for DAI</h4>
<p>Open <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a>, a DEX aggregator or website which searches across the top DEXes to find you the best price for your trade.</p>
<p><a href="https://dex.ag/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7614" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_162-1-282x300.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="744" /></a></p>
<p>By default, DEX.AG is set to BUY Dai with ETH. For the purposes of this guide, let&#8217;s switch to SELL ETH for DAI. Next, enter the amount of ETH you&#8217;d like to swap for DAI. You can check your total ETH balance under MetaMask.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> enter your total balance to swap &#8211; You need to keep some ETH to pay for network transaction fees called gas. Your typical transaction will cost you between $0.10 to as high as a few dollars depending on what type of transaction you&#8217;re sending and the network fees at that moment; so keep at least few dollars worth of ETH for this swap and future transactions from your wallet. For reference, at the time of writing this ETH&#8217;s price is currently ~$213 so keeping anywhere between 0.05 and 0.1 ETH in your wallet would more than cover any transaction fees for a while.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve entered the amount (minus the ETH set aside for gas), click the &#8216;Find Trades&#8217; button. You should see a list of DEXes appear on your screen. Then, click the &#8216;Sell Now&#8217; button on the DEX closest to the top. This will initiate a trade with the DEX you&#8217;ve selected with the details you&#8217;ve previously entered. A MetaMask prompt will appear.</p>
<p>Since this is the first time your account is interacting with this DEX smart contract, you&#8217;ll have to send two transactions: an approval transaction and then the transaction with your trade. The first time you interact with a smart contract you must submit an Approve transaction which enables that smart contract to transfer your tokens like DAI when necessary.</p>
<p>You have the option to manually adjust your transaction or gas fee before sending. This could potentially save you time (preventing a transaction that might get stuck with too low of fees) and money. Click &#8216;EDIT&#8217; under the &#8216;Gas Fee&#8217; row of this window &gt; Advanced tab at the top of the window. You can always check <a href="http://ethgasstation.info/">ETH Gas Station</a> for the recommended fast gas price. Enter your desired amount into the &#8216;Gas Price&#8217; box. Click &#8216;Save&#8217; and then &#8216;Confirm&#8217; to send your transaction.</p>
<p>Wait a few moments for the transaction to be confirmed. To follow the confirmation status of your transaction, open the MetaMask menu, click the pending transaction and click the diagonal arrow on the right which reads &#8216;View on Etherscan&#8217; on hovered over. Etherscan is a block explorer where you can follow transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Once confirmed, click the &#8216;Sell Now&#8217; button for that same DEX again. This will initiate your trade. Repeat the step above to confirm and send your transaction. The DAI should arrive in your wallet once its confirmed.</p>
<h2>6. Turn DAI into cDAI via Compound Finance</h2>
<h4>Compare lending rates</h4>
<p>Normally, I&#8217;d recommend you <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">compare interest rates</a> before choosing a lending service. But for the simplicity&#8217;s sake, we&#8217;ll be teaching you to use the arguably most popular DeFi lending service Compound Finance.</p>
<h4><a href="https://app.compound.finance/asset/cDAI"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7617" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_163-300x273.jpg" alt="" width="725" height="660" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_163-300x273.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_163-768x699.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_163.jpg 934w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></a></h4>
<h4>Enable DAI on Compound</h4>
<p>Navigate to the <a href="https://app.compound.finance/">Compound app</a>. If not prompted, connect your MetaMask wallet by selecting the button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Select MetaMask and unlock your wallet. Next, select <a href="https://app.compound.finance/asset/cDAI">Dai</a> from the menu and click the green &#8216;Enable DAI&#8217; button. This will pop up an Approve transaction which you&#8217;ll confirm using the same steps as before. To follow the confirmation status of your transaction, open the MetaMask menu, click the pending transaction and click the diagonal arrow on the right.</p>
<h4>Supply DAI to Compound and begin earning interest</h4>
<p>Once your approve transaction is confirmed, you should see two buttons: a green &#8216;Supply&#8217; button and a purple &#8216;Borrow&#8217; button under the Dai section of Compound. Click &#8216;Supply&#8217; and enter the amount of DAI you&#8217;d like to supply/lend (or select MAX). After entering in the amount, click the &#8216;Supply&#8217; button at the bottom of the pop-up menu which will open up a MetaMask transaction. Confirm the details of this transaction like before, click &#8216;Confirm&#8217;, and then wait for the transaction to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Congratulations! With your cDAI now in your MetaMask wallet, you&#8217;re gaining passive interest every 12 seconds. You can view the current interest rate at <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">DeFi Pulse</a> or <a href="https://compound.finance/markets">Compound</a> under Dai Supply APR. Welcome to the future of finance.</p>
<h1>Risks and Considerations</h1>
<h4>You can forget your seed phrase or not properly back them up</h4>
<p>If you lose access to your wallet and do not have your seed phrase, there&#8217;s no way to recover the funds locked inside that wallet. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important for you to write down the seed phrase and store it somewhere safe.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s never a bad idea to consider what might happen in an emergency. What if your house burned down? Having an extra copy of your seed phrase secured off-site (i.e. in a safety deposit box) is never a bad idea.</p>
<h4>Your seed phrase could be stolen whether physically or digitally <b></b></h4>
<p>As previously mentioned, if someone gets access to your seed phrase, they can take allow of your assets stored within that wallet. NEVER enter your seed phrase into a website. Phishing emails and websites are common ways for thieves to deceive users into divulging their private key or seed phrase.</p>
<h4><b>There can be flaws, bugs or vulnerabilities in Maker affecting DAI</b></h4>
<p>Maker takes risk seriously with systems in place to manage risk within its smart contract credit system as well as in that system&#8217;s programming. Several <a href="https://github.com/makerdao/audits">third party audits</a> have been conducted on Maker&#8217;s code to sweep for bugs.</p>
<p>These precautions are very important to minimizing the risk in the system. However, there are still possible risks. The Maker team has put together a comprehensive <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#risks-and-their-mitigation">Risks and their Mitigations section</a> in their whitepaper. And here&#8217;s a 3 part <a href="https://medium.com/makerdao/makerdao-governance-risk-framework-38625f514101">blog series</a> outlining their Governance Risk Framework. In this framework, dedicated risk teams construct risk management models for the entire collateral portfolio. Careful management of risk in their asset portfolio helps ensure the system remains stable even in times of high market volatility.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a risk that is known but its not possible to eliminate at this time. Maker uses a set of off-chain price feeds to determine the price of ETH on-chain. MakerDAO&#8217;s medianizer smart contract finds the median price between all the feeds which is then used for nearly every function of a CDP. These price feeds could be manipulated by an attacker or the medianizer itself could subject to a bug or undiscovered vulnerability. To date, no such attack or bug has occurred.</p>
<h4><b>There can be flaws, bugs or vulnerabilities in Compound affecting cDAI</b></h4>
<p>Compound&#8217;s code has been audited several times. The most <a href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-audit/">recent audit</a> performed in August 2019 by OpenZepplin found no bugs of Critical Severity. However, a few risks were found in the design of their incentive structure. Previously, Trail of Bits performed <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/compound-2.pdf">audited</a> Compound&#8217;s v2 upgrade in May 2019. Compound has also been formally verified in partnership with <a class="di ca lm ln lo lp" href="https://www.certora.com/?source=post_page---------------------------">Certora</a>.</p>
<p>Compound Labs, Inc., the developer of the protocol, currently controls the admin address for Compound. The admin address has the right to support additional assets, upgrade the price feed oracle, upgrade the interest rate models, and upgrade the risk model of the protocol. While they plan on fully decentralizing this and handing control to the community, in the meantime the admin address introduces possible vulnerabilities (as expressed by community member Ameen Soleimani to the integrity of Compound&#8217;s function. It should be noted that such vulnerabilities or attacks have not occurred to date.</p>
<h4><b>You could die rendering your cryptocurrency inaccessible to friends or family</b></h4>
<p>Life is unpredictable, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t plan for the worst. Consider how your friends or loved ones would go about accessing your wallet if something were to happen to you. There&#8217;s no perfect solution to this problem. So, you&#8217;ll have to come up with a plan that works best for you.</p>
<h4><b>Know the legal and tax obligations</b></h4>
<p>We aren&#8217;t going to give you legal or tax advice. Nor are we qualified to. However, you should be aware that owning cryptocurrency, like any financial asset, comes with tax repercussions. And, you&#8217;ll almost definitely owe taxes for earning interest in DeFi. Consult a tax professional in your area for more information.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Don&#8217;t let this final section of risks and considerations scare you though. Any and every investment in the world comes with varying degrees of risk. It&#8217;s up to you to exercise proper to take precautions and mitigate those risks. DeFi is no different.
