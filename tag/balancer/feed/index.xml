										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you follow DeFi, you’ve probably noticed that the concept of yield farming is everywhere lately. From some of the most original memes in the Ethereum ecosystem to traditional news outlets like Forbes, crop rotation to maximize yield across protocols has become one of the defining activities on DeFi in 2020.</p>



<h3><strong>So, what is Yield Farming?</strong></h3>



<p>Yield farming is the act of leveraging different DeFi protocols and products to earn a yield or a return on their assets, in some cases obtaining profits well over 100% APY through a combination of lending interest and token incentives. </p>



<p>The recent yield farming frenzy made total value Locked (TVL) on DeFi skyrocket to new all-time highs, zooming far past $2B. Yield farming has had a substantial impact on protocols like Compound, Balancer, Curve, MCDEX, and Uniswap V2 just to name a few as DeFi users aim to cash in on the trend. This frenzy has brought some important questions to light. Should short term speculative usage of the Ethereum network be considered an indicator of long term adoption? Is this frenzy only a momentary activity that will lose traction once yields go down? Ultimately, is this the beginning of a new growth cycle for Ethereum?</p>



<h3><strong>How Did The Yield Farming Frenzy begin?</strong></h3>



<p>The Yield Farming frenzy started when Compound began the live distribution of COMP, its governance token, on June 14th. Compound reached more than $600M total value locked, and overtook MakerDAO for the first time ever on DeFi Pulse’s leaderboard, making it the #1 protocol in DeFi by this measure in a matter of days. However, COMP appears to have only been the beginning with Balancer having launched their protocol rewards incentive program in May started their live distribution a few days after Compound. Balancer experienced similar exponential growth, adding more than $70M TVL.</p>



<p>Although the frenzy started with COMP, yield farming has been known and practiced in DeFi for some time now. Synthetix, for example, had introduced the concept of protocol token rewards in exchange for liquidity provision to the sETH/ETH pool on Uniswap V1 in July 2019.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today marks the end of an era. Right as yield farming is taking off we just finalised a poll on SCCP-29 <a href="https://t.co/bXU07AjQsd">https://t.co/bXU07AjQsd</a>. This was the original yield farming pool for sETH:ETH on Uniswap V1. So as it winds down, let&#39;s take a little trip down memory lane.</p>&mdash; kain.eth (@kaiynne) <a href="https://twitter.com/kaiynne/status/1276417760222797825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Things really started taking off a few hours after COMP began being distributed and users started heavily investing in the USDT market on Compound, the one paying the highest amount of COMP rewards. COMP is distributed on a 50%-50% basis between suppliers and borrowers of a given market, and total rewards are allocated in a proportional way to each market’s yield returns. One of the many strategies that were applied was taking out USDT loans with DAI as collateral and investing them in the corresponding market on Compound. Next, BAT became the most profitable market for COMP farming. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just went short on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$USDT</a> using <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DAI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$DAI</a> as collateral on <a href="https://t.co/cnckUC54V0">https://t.co/cnckUC54V0</a> using maximum <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24COMP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$COMP</a> mining recipe.<br><br>Looks like I&#39;m earning way more than I&#39;m paying interest with the current <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24COMP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$COMP</a> price hovering around ~$60.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/YOLO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#YOLO</a> <a href="https://t.co/03YGZm0Jui">pic.twitter.com/03YGZm0Jui</a></p>&mdash; Samyak Jain (@smykjain) <a href="https://twitter.com/smykjain/status/1272634332599824390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Compound’s team proposed to update the system’s liquidity incentive one week after COMP distribution went live on June 27th. The proposal looked to discourage an inorganic demand for BAT and other assets since users were concentrating extreme liquidation risks into these markets. The new liquidity incentive proposal was executed on July 2nd. Currently, COMP is distributed proportionally across the markets that borrow more dollars, and not dollars of interest paid. Rewards continue to be distributed on a 50%-50% basis between suppliers and borrowers of a given market. You can read more about <a href="https://compound.comradery.io/post/1762">Compound’s proposal to update the system’s liquidity incentives here.<br><br></a>The liquidity incentive effectively discouraged farmers from leveraging markets such as BAT. And now, yield farmers have ballooned the Compound DAI markets to levels higher than the total DAI in existence.  You can check out <a href="https://compound.finance/markets">the current Compound markets here</a> and <a href="https://compound.finance/governance/comp">COMP distribution here</a>.</p>



<p>Balancer began its live distribution of BAL on June 23rd, which caused a spike of more than $50M in TVL in a few days. You likely recall our previous DeFi Pulse Drop with <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/balancer-start-liquidity-mining-and-earn-bal-tokens-today/">Balancer Labs announcing their liquidity incentive program, which allows users to earn BAL on top of pool swap fees</a>. Seventy-five million BAL tokens (75% of fully diluted supply) will be distributed among liquidity providers on a 145K weekly basis.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Is this the beginning of a new growth cycle for DeFi?</strong></h3>



<p>The current Yield Farming frenzy has some resemblances with the ICO frenzy of 2017, in which billions of dollars were invested across many tokens, which ultimately proved to be worthless.<strong> One of the main differences with today’s Governance Tokens is that these are being issued by protocols that <em>already have running products that provide value to the ecosystem</em>, instead of being outright scams.</strong> Even though it’s probable that today’s high yields will face a market correction and be lowered at some point, the current frenzy might still continue for some time. And as we have learned in the past, adoption increases after each frenzy: more users and developers are driven to the ecosystem, and the allocated capital funds the development of new innovations that are later used by a broader ecosystem.</p>

<p>Liquidity is paramount to the growth of DeFi. Many DApps require reliable pools of liquidity to function. One of the most interesting project&#8217;s innovating in the pool liquidity space is Balancer. If you haven&#8217;t heard of Balancer, now&#8217;s a great time to learn because Balancer is about to start distributing BAL tokens to liquidity providers on June 1st, 2020 at 00:00 UTC. We&#8217;re working with Balancer Labs to get the word out about this Liquidity Mining process as part of our DeFi Pulse Drop series.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8278" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>What is Balancer?</h2>



<p>Balancer is a non-custodial generalized automatic market maker (AMM) protocol that launched in March of this year. Yes, that&#8217;s a mouthful but it&#8217;s easy to understand once you break it down. You&#8217;re probably familiar with AMM exchange models like Uniswap, but where Balancer differs is the fact it&#8217;s generalized making it suitable for all sorts of needs, but more on that in a bit.</p>



<h3>Balancer pools are like self-balancing index funds</h3>



<p>Anyone can create a Balancer pool and add liquidity to the protocol. However, what makes Balancer pools so unique is that you aren&#8217;t restricted to pools with the typical 50/50 split between two tokens we&#8217;re used to. Balancer pools support up to 8 tokens with custom distributions. For example, a pool could be 30% WETH, 30% MKR, and 30% USDC, and 10% LINK while another pool is 80% WETH and 20% DAI. </p>



<p>Balancer uses smart order routing (SOR) to route users&#8217; trades to the pools that combined provide the best rate possible. Essentially, Balancer pools are like self-balancing index funds but instead of charging you fees you actually get paid for contributing your liquidity.</p>



<h3>Different pools for different needs</h3>



<p>As previously mentioned, Balancer liquidity pools are highly flexible and can be optimized for specific use cases. Balancer Labs has even released templates for new innovative pool designs. Take for instance <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/building-liquidity-into-token-distribution-a49d4286e0d4">Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools</a> (LBPs) that communities can use to build deep liquidity for their token. Or even, <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/zero-impermanent-loss-stablecoin-pool-with-lending-interests-a3da6d8bb782">stablecoin pools with zero impermanent-loss</a>.</p>



<h2>Balancer Protocol Governance Token (BAL)</h2>



<p>Balancer V1 initially launched with no native token; this latest update to Balancer introduces the Balancer Protocol Governance Token (BAL). BAL holders will determine the future of Balancer protocol, making decisions like implementing new features, potential protocol fees, or even bigger picture plans like whether to use layer 2 scaling and/or deploy contracts on other blockchains. </p>



<p>Out of the total supply of 100M BAL tokens, 25M were initially allocated to founders, core devs, advisors and investors and are all subject to vesting periods. The remaining 75M BAL tokens will be mostly distributed to users who provide liquidity to Balancer pools in a process called <strong>liquidity mining</strong>. </p>



<h2>Liquidity mining &#8211; Earn BAL on top of pool returns</h2>



<p>For a protocol like Balancer to remain decentralized, the governance process also needs to be decentralized. And, it only makes sense for those that use the protocol the most to be given a voice in said process. This is exactly what Balancer&#8217;s liquidity mining aims to do. </p>



<p>Each week, 145k BAL will be awarded to users with liquidity in Balancer pools, totaling 7.5M BAL per year. The idea is to create a really strong incentive for early adopters grow liquidity and get involved in the governance process.</p>



<p><strong>Starting on June 1st, 2020 at 00:00 UTC (which is tonight if you&#8217;re reading this Sunday May 31st), those currently providing liquidity to Balancer protocol will be eligible to receive BAL tokens.</strong> So now&#8217;s your chance to <a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/">add liquidity or create a new pool</a> to reap the benefits of being that early adopter.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;All liquidity providers will receive Balancer Protocol Governance Tokens as long as a USD price can be extracted from CoinGecko for at least 2 tokens present in their liquidity pools. Liquidity from tokens without such USD price is not eligible.&#8221;</em></p>



<h3>Earn BAL on top of pool swap fees</h3>



<p>Every Balancer pool has its own customized <em>pool swap fee</em>; whenever someone performs a trade that utilizes the pool&#8217;s liquidity, this fee is distributed equally to that pool&#8217;s liquidity providers. So when you provide liquidity not only are you earning this fee, but you&#8217;re also earning BAL </p>



<h3>Liquidity mining encourages lower pool fees</h3>



<p>One of the coolest parts of liquidity mining is that it&#8217;s designed to incentivize pools to have low pool swap fees. The USD value of each pool&#8217;s underlying tokens according to CoinGecko is multiplied by what&#8217;s called a <em>feeFactor</em> to determine how many BAL the pool is eligible to receive. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="621" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-1024x621.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8277" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-1024x621.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-300x182.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-768x466.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x.png 1362w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As you can see in the chart above, the higher the fee, the lower this feeFactor is, and the less BAL tokens that pool&#8217;s liquidity providers receive each week. The logic is that pools with lower fees pull in more users willing to trade on Balancer and so these pools should receive greater rewards. Personally, I think it&#8217;s a clever way to optimize Balancer to achieve lower fees while still rewarding liquidity providers accordingly.</p>



<h2>Don&#8217;t miss out. Liquidity mining starts soon.</h2>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried it yet, there&#8217;s never been a better time to consider <a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/">adding liquidity to existing pools or creating your own pool</a>. <strong>Starting tonight Sunday 31st (June 1st, 2020 at 00:00 UTC to be precise), those currently providing liquidity to Balancer protocol will be eligible to receive BAL</strong>. Not only will you earn BAL, getting involved early is also a great way to ensure Balancer works best for you, implementing changes you want to see as a stakeholder in the protocol.</p>
