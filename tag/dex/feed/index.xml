										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The origin of the Sanskrit word <em>guru</em> is said to be based on the syllables<em> gu</em> (‡§ó‡•Å) and <em>ru</em> (‡§∞‡•Å), which stand for darkness and &#8220;light that dispels it.&#8221; Gurus cast out the darkness of ignorance with the light of their wisdom. To become a guru, you must be able to take in your surroundings to gain perspective and glean greater wisdom. DexGuru wants to be your guide lighting the way through the dark forest. <a href="https://dex.guru/">DexGuru</a> harmonizes permissionless, real-time data and analytics of every on-chain market in a single UI capable of trading across DEXes.</p>



<h2>Trade with more awareness with real-time on-chain market data</h2>



<p>It‚Äôs 2021. Traders like you need more than a simple From / To interface when it comes to determining how and when to execute your strategy. <a href="https://dex.guru/">DexGuru</a> offers a better way to monitor on-chain markets for any token on Uniswap, Sushiswap, and Pancakeswap. Traders using DexGuru have permissionless access to data in real-time including charting, liquidity, pool activity, trading volume, and trading history. So what does permissionless access mean to you? It means you can copy and paste any token address into DexGuru‚Äôs search bar and tap into loads of information generated from analysis of on-chain trading activity for free.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://dex.guru/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9147" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1536x864.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui-1568x882.png 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dexguru-ui.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>We might be biased towards the color purple here but&#8230; DexGuru is rather sleek looking, combining various data feeds into a responsive and appealing UI/UX. View charts and trading data in real-time for any token as trades occur to stay more informed with what‚Äôs happening on-chain. Want to know more about the token you‚Äôre viewing? Simply click the DYOR button at the top of the page and get a rundown of that token‚Äôs basic info and community links. Beyond price and trade history, traders and farmers alike can utilize real-time liquidity data to monitor when liquidity is added or removed from pools. Not to mention, DexGuru can give you insights into the behaviors of other traders in the market, but we‚Äôll get to that later.</p>



<h3>Become one with the flow &#8211; executing trades on multiple chains from one UI</h3>



<p>Under the hood, DexGuru uses the 0x API to provide users with gas-efficient order routing. Connect your wallet and select your network to buy and sell tokens on EVM-compatible chains. There is no more waiting for token listings because DexGuru permissionlessly indexes each token market. In other words, when it is added to the DEX, it‚Äôs added to DexGuru. </p>



<p>Trade orders are routed through any 0x API connected exchange including Uniswap, Kyber, Curve, Balancer, CREAM, Bancor, mStable, Shell, Swerve, SnowSwap, SushiSwap, DODO, Mooniswap(1inch protocol AMM), PancakeSwap, BakerySwap, Mooniswap, DODO_V2, SushiSwap, Nerve Finance, Belt Finance, and Ellipsis.</p>



<h2>Gain more insight with DexGuru‚Äôs real-time on-chain analytics</h2>



<p>One of the most interesting features DexGuru has to offer is the deeper analysis it performs on user trading history. DexGuru is constantly monitoring on-chain markets for new trades. When a new trade is received, DexGuru analyzes the trader‚Äôs address and marks it with a special emoji in the pool activity or trading history.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="345" height="342" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image.png 345w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-300x297.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/image-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></figure>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f422.png" alt="üê¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8211; Casual Trader with $10k-$100k of a trading volume last 30 days<br><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f988.png" alt="ü¶à" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8211; Active Trader with $100k-$500k of a trading volume last 30 days<br><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f433.png" alt="üê≥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8211; Heavy Trader with $500k+ of a trading volume last 30 days<br><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f916.png" alt="ü§ñ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8211; Trader with 1000+ TXs in last 30 days. Most likely a bot.</p>



<p>These sorts of analytics in the heat of the moment can help you as a trader reassess the situation. It‚Äôs a refreshing dose of signal among the noise when you need it. It‚Äôs nice to know when you‚Äôre swimming with the whales or interacting with a bot. Put simply, DexGuru‚Äôs real-time insights aim to give traders an edge. And what‚Äôs not to like about emojis?</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>Since its initial public beta release on February 17th, many more exciting developments have been brewing for DexGuru. DexGuru aims to add all major EVM-compatible L1 and L2 networks with significant on-chain activity before the end of the year. To that end, DexGuru <a href="https://blog.dex.guru/seed">has raised $1M in a private seed round </a>to continue building its Web3 trading platform. So keep your eyes out for new DEXes, networks, and features in the future.</p>



<p>No need to trade in the dark. Let DexGuru shed light on the token markets you trade. Check out <a href="https://dex.guru/">DexGuru</a> and see how you can utilize its information-driven UI/UX in your strategy.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DODO is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform powered by a unique Proactive Market Making (PMM) algorithm. <a href="https://dodoex.io/">DODO</a>‚Äôs PMM algorithm was developed entirely in-house by the DODO team iterating on the design of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) to improve capital efficiency, reduce impermanent loss, and minimize slippage for traders. Inspired by their previous work on DDEX, the DODO team set out to abstract the proactive market making concepts popular on order book-based exchanges into a permissionless on-chain liquidity protocol.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://dodoex.io/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="375" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-1024x375.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9050" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-1024x375.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-300x110.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-768x282.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-1536x563.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-2048x751.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-1568x575.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<h3>DODO‚Äôs Proactive Market Making (PMM) algorithm in action</h3>



<p>To fully grasp what makes proactive market making different, take a step back and ask yourself: what is a market? A simple definition of a market is a place where you can exchange assets. A single trade doesn‚Äôt make a market; it is the constant distillation, distribution, and reaction to the data produced by buyers and sellers‚Äô orders and trades that makes a market. Much of this data is typically represented by the ever-changing collection of orders being placed, removed, and executed from an exchange‚Äôs order books.</p>



<p>Traditional Automated Market Maker (AMM) DEXes automate the process of market making by pooling liquidity for two assets and replacing the order books with a simple fixed curve to determine the current price based on the current amount of each asset held. As the name implies, DODO‚Äôs Proactive Market Making algorithm is capable of proactively adjusting parameters such as asset ratio and curve slope in anticipation of market conditions, resulting in DODO pools that are adaptable and flexible for all sorts of use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO‚Äôs PMM pools can even be configured to utilize external price oracles to minimize impermanent loss and achieve higher capital efficiency. This configurability makes DODO‚Äôs PMM suitable for use cases varying from single-sided liquidity for bootstrapping pools to fully customizable market making strategies that adapt to market conditions in realtime.</p>



<p>Instead of breaking down the math, let‚Äôs explore the <a href="https://medium.com/dodoex/dodo-private-pool-professional-market-making-on-chain-b18a282596e3">DODO Private Pool (DPP)</a>, a feature aimed at professional market makers that best illustrates what makes DODO‚Äôs PMM algorithm special. If you‚Äôre interested in the formula behind DODO‚Äôs PMM, you can dig into the math <a href="https://dodoex.github.io/docs/docs/math">here</a>.</p>



<h3>DODO Private Pool (DPP) puts you, the market maker, in control</h3>



<p>DODO Private Pools put the full power of DODO‚Äôs PMM configurability at your fingertips empowering anyone to be a professional market maker. DPP allows market makers to do the following:</p>



<ol><li>Make one-sided deposits / withdrawals</li><li>Change the pricing curve at any time</li><li>Have liquidity everywhere in the price range from zero to infinity</li></ol>



<p>Imagine you want to be a market maker for ETH/USDC but you‚Äôre worried about ETH popping off and selling all your ETH to traders on the way up. With a DPP, you can perform a one-sided withdrawal to withdraw some of your ETH from the pool for safekeeping. This one-sided reduction of liquidity causes traders to go through the remaining ETH liquidity quickly driving up the price curve quicker than before. This sort of one-sided withdrawal can protect market makers against excessive risk. You can also do the opposite: withdraw USDC in anticipation of ETH‚Äôs price falling thus protecting you against the downside risk.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Unlike a simple AMM, DODO Private Pools allow you as a market maker to customize your strategy, taking advantage of your human brain to actively influence a pool‚Äôs behavior. </p></blockquote>



<p>Say, for example, you feel the current market price of an asset doesn‚Äôt reflect its true value. In this scenario, you aren‚Äôt likely to provide liquidity for a simple AMM pool and may even remove liquidity for that asset to avoid impermanent loss. This is because you cannot directly influence the price at which the pool is selling the asset. DODO Private Pools provide a better way with a process called ‚Äòactive price discovery‚Äô which allows you to adjust the market price inside the DPP directly. Ultimately, market makers‚Äô ability to actively influence the price discovery process allows them to utilize their knowledge, experience, and intuition to craft a more efficient market.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>DODO Private Pools can even allow you to create specialized markets like constant price markets for low slippage stable asset swaps. </p><p>This is achieved by market makers setting a DPP‚Äôs k value to a very small non-zero value (e.g. k = 0.001) to get an ‚Äúapproximately constant‚Äù pricing curve not dissimilar to stablecoin swaps on Curve Finance.</p></blockquote>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>While DODO‚Äôs PMM and Private Pools sure are interesting, this dodo isn‚Äôt nearly finished evolving. DODO has lots more features and upgrades planned for this year. We‚Äôll be covering more DODO features in the future. In the meantime, you can always learn more by <a href="https://dodoex.io/">exploring DODO</a>, following DODO on <a href="https://twitter.com/BreederDodo">Twitter</a>, and joining in the discussion happening in the DODO community on <a href="https://t.me/dodoex_official">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/sWKnV6fRqm">Discord</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Many would argue that generating yield with stablecoins is currently one of DeFi‚Äôs biggest use cases. So it‚Äôs no wonder we‚Äôve seen a flurry of different stablecoins, yield aggregators and vaults entering the market, each with their own tokenized representation of yield-bearing stablecoins. You can almost picture these yield-bearing tokens like snowflakes; each similar at a glance but entirely unique when examined closely. When snowflakes are combined they become an indistinguishable mass that can be shaped to create something more like a snowman or igloo. Whether you prefer to look at protocols and tokens like snowflakes or money legos, there are undeniable benefits to combining and layering different DeFi protocols to create something new. This is precisely the logic behind <a href="https://snowswap.org/">SnowSwap</a> which aims to be the defacto way to swap yield-bearing assets like stablecoins, tokenized BTC, ETH2 staking tokens and other similar assets.</p>



<h2>What is SnowSwap?</h2>



<p>Imagine you have USDC deposited into yEarn‚Äôs yUSDC vault but you notice you could be earning a higher yield using yDAI. You could pay the gas required for all the transactions to withdraw your USDC, convert it to DAI, and then re-deposit your DAI into Yearn or you could save yourself the hassle and use SnowSwap. <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/snowswap-bringing-liquidity-to-stablecoin-yield-farming-12e222af0462">SnowSwap</a>, based on Curve‚Äôs AMM model, allows users to easily enter and exit yVaults and other yield bearing tokens for only the cost of a swap fee. Increasing liquidity for similar yield-bearing tokens makes it easier for users to speculate on their yield or performance. SnowSwap‚Äôs first pools, <a href="https://snowswap.org/iearn/">yVault USD</a> (yDAI, yUSDC, yUSDT, yTUSD) and <a href="https://snowswap.org/busd/">yVault Curve</a> (yUSD, ybCRV), were focused on yield-bearing stablecoin tokens. It didn‚Äôt stop at stablecoins though; the <a href="https://snowswap.org/pusd/">btcSNOW pool</a> (YcrvRenWSBTC, FcrvRenWBTC) features yield-bearing tokenized versions of BTC from yEarn and Harvest Finance.</p>



<p>The next step in SnowSwap‚Äôs journey went even further by introducing a new pool called <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/%EF%B8%8Fbuilding-on-2-0-with-eth2snow-and-sharedstake-partnership-%EF%B8%8F-5ca251f8e1a0">eth2SNOW</a> designed to incentivize Eth2 adoption. SnowSwap‚Äôs <a href="https://snowswap.org/ethsnow/">eth2SNOW pool</a> aims to create new markets and utility via the ability to enter, exit, and swap between popular eth2 staking services with low slippage. This pool includes vETH2, aETH by ANKR, CRETH2 by CREAM, WETH. eth2SNOW provides a few key advantages for users:</p>



<ul><li>Enables users to conveniently enter and exit Eth2 staking services using WETH</li><li>Allows users to optimize for the highest APY % with low slippage swaps</li><li>Alleviates minimum ETH entry required for aETH</li><li>Liquidity providers gain exposure to Eth2 staking and earn a portion of swap fees</li></ul>



<p>In general, providing liquidity to SnowSwap‚Äôs pools provides a simpler and more cost effective way to gain exposure to a basket of yield-bearing assets with the added benefit of receiving a portion of swap fees. When a user provides liquidity to a SnowSwap pool, they receive either ySNOW, ycrvSNOW, btcSNOW, eth2SNOW tokens depending on the pool. Liquidity providers can stake these tokens to earn additional yield in the form of SNOW, SnowSwap‚Äôs governance token. 80% of the total SNOW tokens will be distributed to SnowSwap liquidity providers via liquidity mining rewards designed to bootstrap liquidity as well as the SnowSwap community.</p>



<h2>Progressing towards decentralization with The Snow DAO</h2>



<p>The SnowSwap team envisions The Snow DAO to play an important role in the future of SnowSwap. In this vision, <a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/f-k-making-it-rain-were-making-it-snow-e60b64ad1292">SNOW</a> would grant users the ability to vote on governance proposals to modify or add to the SnowSwap protocol. For example, a future proposal could be voted in that distributes swap fees to SNOW holders. Nonetheless, the SnowSwap team<a href="https://medium.com/snowswap/snow-whats-next-29639c181732"> also believes </a>that poorly executed token governance can slow down the growth of a protocol. For this reason,&nbsp; they want to explore the possibilities with the community and collaborate to forge a path towards decentralization together. For example, one idea floated by the SnowSwap team was having community-based executives. In the meantime, the SnowSwap team covers the cost of development via the 10% of SNOW given to the Dev Fund on a 3-year vesting schedule. Additionally, 8% of SNOW was issued to the SnowSwap Foundation, a treasury used to fund initiatives and incentivize the growth of the ecosystem such as security audits, partner programs, and grants.</p>



<h3>Growing the SNOW community with positive-sum feedback loops</h3>



<p>At its core, SnowSwap is exploring the possibilities of forging symbiotic relationships leveraging the positive-sum nature of DeFi. Its pools provide liquidity between tokens staked in various DeFi protocols, creating a market to swap these tokens which had previously been so fragmented and illiquid. This encourages users to engage with these tokens and in turn creates additional utility for their respective communities. Members of these communities who use SnowSwap, earning them SNOW rewards, then also become members of the SnowSwap community. You can probably see where this leads‚Ä¶ the more projects SnowSwap provides utility to, the more the communities grow, and so on to form a positive sum feedback loop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In line with this positive-sum mentality, The SnowSwap Foundation will invest in initiatives and teams which add value to the SnowSwap ecosystem. This strategy referred to as ‚ÄòOffensive Forkability‚Äô supports community experimentation and encourages innovation. For example, grants could be funded to explore protocol design experiments. The goal of this strategy is to create network value by collaborating with SnowSwap to disincentivize vampire attacks. In other words, the strategy embodies the phrase: ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt beat them, join them.‚Äù</p>



<h2>So what‚Äôs in store for SnowSwap?</h2>



<p>SnowSwap is keeping busy between new partnerships and crossing community milestones. The self-proclaimed army of ‚ÄúWhite Walkers&#8221; continues to grow with recently launched dedicated communities for its SnowSwap users in Bangladesh, Vietnam, and India. <a href="https://twitter.com/Quantstamp/status/1343744581007933440?s=20">Quantstamp reviewed SnowSwap‚Äôs contracts</a> clearing the path to more major partnerships. Meanwhile, the eth2SNOW pool made in partnership with ANKR now has over 1000 ETH tokens. And now, it‚Äôs been<a href="https://twitter.com/snow_swap/status/1353059315968479232"> announced</a> that 1inch is integrating SnowSwap‚Äôs liquidity pools. SnowSwap pools will likely see increased trading volume from DEX aggregators and earn more trading fees for liquidity providers as a result.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the sound of it, there‚Äôs even more brewing behind the scenes. SnowSwap told us that they have 5 major partners that they plan to reveal in the near future. So don‚Äôt be surprised to see new potential pools, tokenized assets and/or other developments coming soon. To be the first to hear about these new partnerships, we recommend you follow SnowSwap on the platform of your choice: <a href="https://discord.com/invite/CSSJTs4">Discord</a>, <a href="https://t.me/Snow_Swap">Telegram</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/snow_swap">Twitter</a>.</p>



<p>If you haven‚Äôt already, we recommend you go <a href="https://snowswap.org/">check out SnowSwap</a> and see how its low slippage AMM design can offer you more convenience and utility.<br><br><br><em>Disclosure: This post is part of our paid promotional DeFi Pulse Drop series; We‚Äôve partnered with SnowSwap to help educate and inform the community about their protocol.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let‚Äôs face it&#8230; In the heat of the moment when it matters most you want to be using the fastest, cheapest way to execute that critical trade. And when you trade on most DEXes, network congestion and the subsequent high gas fees impact your performance. Pay too low of a gas price and you‚Äôll be stuck waiting around, sometimes only to have your transaction revert. So, your other option is to crank up the gas price and pay gas fees which add up over time, eating into your profits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These limitations can lead to a less-than-desirable experience for traders, especially those coming from centralized exchanges. Over the past few years, countless hours of research have gone into creating layer 2 technologies that allow DeFi applications like DEXes to scale far beyond what‚Äôs possible on layer 1. DeversiFi has made it their mission to provide a professional trading platform for traders as the first exchange on Ethereum to adopt StarkWare‚Äôs Validium Rollups Layer 2 scaling technology.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>DeversiFi in a nutshell</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.deversifi.com/"><strong>DeversiFi</strong></a><strong> is a self-custodial layer 2 DEX capable of processing up to 9000 transactions per second by utilizing zero-knowledge transaction batching technology. </strong>The next chapter for DeversiFi and the Nectar ecosystem begins soon with the launch of Nectar Beehive V1, a liquidity mining initiative designed to further bootstrap the Nectar community and produce sustainable, long-term liquidity for the NEC ecosystem.</p>



<h1>The Evolution of DeversiFi</h1>



<p>When you hear the term ‚Äòliquidity mining‚Äô you probably think of fly-by-night food token farms, however NEC, the token of the DeversiFi ecosystem, is in a category of its own. DeversiFi and the Nectar ecosystem have been pioneers of <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/introducing-the-nectar-token-58ba40e5419a/">liquidity mining in the DeFi space since 2017</a> and are backed by notable partners such as ParaFi Capital, D1 Ventures, BR Capital, StarkWare, Bitfinex, ConsenSys, and Infura.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Originally <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/279">incubated by Bitfinex</a> (now fully independent), DeversiFi began as Ethfinex Trustless, a decentralized exchange with a hybrid infrastructure with deep-liquidity from aggregated order books which access liquidity from exchanges like Bitfinex. <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/introducing-the-nectar-token-58ba40e5419a/">Nectar (NEC) was introduced in 2017</a> as one of the first liquidity mining tokens as a way to reward Ethfinex users with a stake in the future development, governance and success of the platform. Ethfinex eventually closed its doors in August 2019 leaving behind 17000 ETH which was entrusted to NEC holders via the Nectar DAO, or NecDAO for short.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Piecing together DeversiFi, NEC, and NecDAO</h1>



<p>Nectar‚Äôs original purpose was to incentivize liquidity on Ethfinex offering 50% of the centralized exchange‚Äôs trading fees. But after Ethfinex closed its doors, the remaining 17,000 ETH was passed onto the Nectar DAO and <a href="https://nectar.community/whitepaper">the role of NEC tokens has since expanded</a> to become the governance and utility token of the Nectar and DeversiFi ecosystem. The primary goal of Nectar is to grow the world‚Äôs largest community of decentralized exchange users. NEC tokens can be staked to earn reputation and become a voting member of NecDAO. Learn more about <a href="https://nectar.community/dao">Nectar DAO</a>.</p>



<p>NEC is deflationary with the supply being reduced over time through a buy-and-burn model. Each week, up to 50% of the revenue from DeversiFi trading fees (based on daily trading volumes) are used to purchase NEC tokens through an open and transparent auction mechanism. These NEC tokens are then burned reducing the total supply.</p>



<p>DeversiFi offers unique trading fee discounts to NEC token holders. On top of the trading fee discounts DeversiFi users receive based on their 30d trading volume, Nectar holders will soon be entitled to additional discounts of up to 20% depending on the average amount of Nectar tokens that they hold (and have locked inside DeversiFi) for the past 30 days. For example, if a trader expects to do 10 million USD of trading volume every 30 days, buying and holding 100,000 NEC could save them ~$4000 in fees per 30 days.</p>



<p>You can see how DeversiFi and NecDAO have a symbiotic relationship. The more users trade on DeversiFi, the more NEC tokens are burned, the more valuable NEC becomes, the greater the value of the potential discounts NEC holders can receive. NecDAO and NEC holders benefit from generating proposals which improve DeversiFi and attract more trading volume. DeversiFi, in turn, has a dedicated community of NEC stakeholders that boost trading volumes and generally promote their platform.</p>



<h1>Introducing Beehive, Nectar‚Äôs new liquidity mining initiative<img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AEwu1MgeUK5S0tl0uXQodikfIOanlcWYVuse6Q0MkTmU9aiFDKMarX9s6vMtzaK1eXFSeyBU7p17Q0aAKtFmA6dYlSWSIR3tU3XV-KAkfWxi51od7v-bKYvk7AIGsIhGKiMsljo1" width="624" height="324"></h1>



<p>Nectar Beehive V1 is a new community bootstrapping and liquidity mining initiative for the DeversiFi ecosystem that returns NEC to its roots of rewarding market makers.</p>



<p>Nectar Beehive will allow liquidity providers to stake their tokens and earn NEC and BAL token rewards, offering multipliers up to 2x for those who also trade on DeversiFi. Of course, APY varies and is subject to many factors such as the price of NEC tokens and total participation in Nectar Beehive. Inspired by other popular liquidity mining initiatives, NEC rewards will be&nbsp; vested for 1 year, limiting sell pressure on the market and producing a sustainable source of liquidity for NEC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nectar Beehive V1 officially launches on Tuesday December 1st, 2020. All the need-to-know details will be communicated in their <a href="https://discord.gg/GMtnTZeHpr">Discord</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/deversifi">Twitter</a>. UPDATE: <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/nectar-liquidity-mining/">Learn more about Nectar Beehive V1</a>.</p>



<h1>DeversiFi offers a fast, smooth trading experience</h1>



<p>We recommend you <a href="https://www.deversifi.com/">experience it for yourself</a> to see how it compares to what you‚Äôve come to expect from a DEX or even centralized exchanges. DeversiFi have recently added Hermez Network token offering a 10% kickback to the first 100 users who trade HEZ (<a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/hez-token-now-available-on-deversifi/">details here</a>). In the run-up to Nectar Beehive, various new token pairs will be added allowing Beehivers to trade their favourite tokens while earning NEC.</p>



<h2>High throughput and deep liquidity</h2>



<p>Why are rollups so cool? I‚Äôm glad you asked. I‚Äôm not going to get into all the technical details of how zkSTARKs or Validium rollups work. But in a nutshell, they allow DeversiFi to offer a super fast layer 2 experience while still rooting all security in layer 1, in this case the Ethereum blockchain. DeversiFi was the first DEX to utilize StarkWare‚Äôs transaction batching technology StarkEx which processes and settles trades at extremely high speeds (approx. 9,000 tps).</p>



<p>DeversiFi‚Äôs hybrid infrastructure features allows traders to tap into deep liquidity from aggregated order books including Bitfinex, resulting in self-custodial access to the best prices.</p>



<h2>Gas-Free trading</h2>



<p>No one likes paying high gas fees. They always seem to spike when you need to make an important trade. This typically happens because many traders are competing to ‚Äúoutbid‚Äù other traders to be included in the next block. <strong>DeversiFi users enjoy gas-free trading with instant finality</strong> thanks to its Validium rollups. Trades are processed in batches and securely submitted back to the Ethereum blockchain where customers‚Äô funds are held. There is never any danger of trades being rolled back and rooting the transactions on-chain ensures customers would be able to withdraw their funds in the unlikely case where DeversiFi or StarkWare go offline.</p>



<p>Gas fees are only required to lock and unlock tokens; this is because these interactions take place with DeversiFi‚Äôs smart contract on layer 1.</p>



<h2>Privacy-by-default</h2>



<p>Don‚Äôt leak that sweet sweet alpha. Validium rollups is one of the only layer 2 technologies on the market that enables private transactions. Privacy let‚Äôs you make the most of opportunities in the market without exposing your strategy to the public blockchain where it can be monitored and reverse-engineered. And while leaking alpha is bad, your data potentially falling into more nefarious hands is worse.</p>



<p>Don‚Äôt underestimate the value of privacy when it comes to DeFi. Although the community is small now, DeFi is likely to grow into a wider mainstream market where bad actors may increasingly look to take advantage of personal data stored forever on the blockchain. As the saying goes: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>



<h1>DeversiFi‚Äôs roadmap aims to uniquely position the platform for the future</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/21xwQM4KCgKndacOHO9kIz_maga7Vzgs9-iIixBnsvt8iOB_yU7gblPBPY6sGC83NiaVwveE3PPmh-F10UeJ83-PPpop0dwIcGnn9LYmSeEGhGxWFR9btYjQRgp4Lr7g7rUpbL_C" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/deversifi-public-roadmap/"></a></p>



<p>Composability between platforms is the major game changer of DeFi. Within the next few months, DeFi is likely to experience an explosive growth in the number of protocols available on layer 1 in addition to the new and existing services migrating to layer 2. DeversiFi‚Äôs hybrid architecture and history of adaptation makes it uniquely situated to capitalize on the potential composability between layer 1 and layer 2 platforms as well as the opportunities that arise from bridging decentralized and centralized services like CEXs/DEXs.</p>



<p>Let‚Äôs discuss some features coming up on DeversiFi‚Äôs roadmap. Head <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/deversifi-public-roadmap/">here</a> for a full public roadmap.</p>



<h2>Rapid Withdrawals and DeversiFi EARN</h2>



<p>I haven‚Äôt met a person yet who enjoys the agony that is waiting for a withdrawal from an&nbsp; exchange. Previously, DeversiFi users would be required to wait until another batch of transactions is submitted to the blockchain in order to withdraw their funds. This can sometimes take a few hours depending on network congestion. With new rapid withdrawal functionality, DeversiFi users will be able to withdraw instantly, paying a fee and essentially ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù liquidity from the DeversiFi EARN pool. Users can provide liquidity to DeversiFi EARN to earn fees for enabling rapid withdrawals. Both parties benefit from the arrangement: liquidity providers earn passive returns and traders have the option to skip the wait for a convenience fee.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conditional transfers open the door for enhanced composability</h2>



<p>Beyond fast withdrawals, conditional transfers open the door to many new possibilities and arbitrage opportunities for DeversiFi users. This upgrade would allow users to withdraw to new or different addresses, deposit from one address directly into their DeversiFi trading account, and it can even allow traders to make custom transactions directly interacting with other DeFi protocols on layer 1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can imagine how this lowers the opportunity cost of holding funds in DeversiFi. DeversiFi users benefit from being positioned to effectively seize potential opportunities across centralized and decentralized layer 1 and layer 2 DEXes, improving the overall efficiency of the market.</p>



<h2>Exploring synergies between DeFi and centralized services</h2>



<p>DeversiFi has been exploring a number of things that would further enhance DeversiFi‚Äôs hybrid architecture including zero-knowledge KYC and several regulatory licenses that would allow them to provide regulated products such as derivatives and leverage to even traders based out of the United States.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>DeversiFi has put a lot of time and effort into building a very uniquely situated trading platform. When you put all the pieces together, it‚Äôs easy to see DeversiFi and the Nectar community are dedicated to building a platform that is sustainable with long-term goals. Experience what layer 2 has to offer today by trading on <a href="https://www.deversifi.com/">DeversiFi</a>. And don‚Äôt forget to mark your calendar for the launch of <a href="https://beehive.nectar.community/#/beehive">Beehive</a>! Thanks for reading.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A vampire attack or ‚Äúvampire mining‚Äù is a new term in DeFi popularized by SushiSwap‚Äôs aggressive migration incentives designed to pull liquidity from Uniswap.</p>



<p>The strategy involves forking an already successful open-source fee-generating protocol, and where opportunities exist, making slight adjustments to better incentivize participants in the new protocol, encouraging the migration of already existing liquidity for essentially the same purpose.</p>



<p><a href="https://uniswap.org/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwwOz6BRCgARIsAKEG4FVDaI7egyJ4cGSoT7Uc8xLy8Yfd-NFBh3AH8PXuhEGcW3H3pTkesjQaAiAPEALw_wcB">Uniswap</a> made a prime target as it was one of the largest decentralised protocols not to have some sort of governance token or fee distribution token at the time. Uniswap liquidity providers currently share 0.3% fees on all trades made within pools they have provided liquidity to, however the protocol has a <a href="https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2/">lever</a> that can be pulled that redirects 0.05% (16.7%) of this 0.3% fee into a funding pool supposedly for ecosystem development, though there are concerns from some members of the community that this would likely just line the pockets of Uniswap‚Äôs VCs instead.</p>



<p>Thus <a href="https://sushiswapclassic.org/">SushiSwap</a> was born, an almost direct clone of Uniswap except with an additional protocol related token SUSHI. SUSHI acts as both a governance token and a yield token- always sharing between its holders the 0.05% of fees on trades that Uniswap can divert by activating its lever.</p>



<p>This change also allows prior liquidity providers to continue to earn fees from the protocol even after withdrawing their liquidity from the SUSHI tokens they‚Äôve earned- strongly rewarding early participants with the aim to bolster its community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>SushiSwap‚Äôs ‚Äúattack,‚Äù as some would call it, hinged on the fact that liquidity providers get Uniswap LP tokens for depositing liquidity in Uniswap‚Äôs pool- redeemable for their share of the pool at any time.</p>



<p>SushiSwap capitalised on this by offering staking contracts where Uniswap LP tokens could be deposited to earn SUSHI tokens. The idea was to have a 2-week early distribution at an enhanced rate where 1000 SUSHI were split between stakers per block to attract a lot of LP tokens, before SushiSwap would mass migrate a tonne of Uniswap‚Äôs liquidity into its own pools by redeeming the staked Uniswap LP tokens and swapping staker‚Äôs Uniswap LP tokens 1 for 1 with SushiSwap SLP tokens, making them whole again in SushiSwap‚Äôs new pools. Trading would then begin and the protocol would continue to emit SUSHI to active liquidity providers at 10% of the early distribution rate.</p>



<p>SushiSwap‚Äôs staking contracts and SUSHI distribution began on August 28th, causing a parabolic rise from about $280m to $1.8B of total value locked (TVL) in Uniswap over 11 days, before the migration occurred a couple of days early on September 8th, causing about $800m of liquidity to be instantly drained to SushiSwap, with Uniswap‚Äôs TVL plunging back to ~$400m.</p>



<p>Interestingly, this is still higher than Uniswap‚Äôs TVL prior to SushiSwap. So despite concerns that SushiSwap could have spelled the end for Uniswap, the whole debacle still seems to have been of net benefit to the protocol.</p>



<p>Another point of debate was whether liquidity providers would remain with SushiSwap once the post-migration rewards fell to 100 SUSHI per block or correct back to the more trusted and time-tested Uniswap.</p>



<p>Whilst the initial distribution was going on, Chef Nomi (SushiSwap‚Äôs anonymous founder) withdrew the entirety of the dev pool- $7m of eth and ~2.5m SUSHI which they sold for ~$6m of Eth on Saturday 5th, making away with around $13m of ETH profit despite early promises not to, causing SUSHI to decline in price and leaving the community in doubt of the future. Chef Nomi however pledged to continue to support the project‚Äôs development.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/nFBb9rskxUfBDSK1cJAwaIY7KrYSY2PwNqUUfn4wOTUJ_Hlxie6OCnT1dxIB6Aoq0-Yu01xPABTLPXvs-pQ9wZbAHJHC0X2audCV1IbSbu6dkpwuaLj691e4DAzbwpcUyKnwYqxM" alt=""/></figure>



<p>A day later they rescinded his commitment and gave control of SushiSwap to the CEO of FTX Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>



<p>&nbsp;In a final twist, Chef Nomi returned all ~$14m of ETH back to SushiSwap‚Äôs treasury on September 11th.</p>



<p>Since then, the community has successfully migrated liquidity to SushiSwap and continued forward with the project, though with everything going on SUSHI has unsurprisingly seen some significant price volatility.</p>



<h3>Is this the start of a trend?</h3>



<p>SushiSwap‚Äôs aggressive liquidity migration from Uniswap might have been the first significant example of a ‚Äúvampire attack‚Äù, but it bears considering it will probably not be the last.</p>



<p>Any protocol where capital is free to leave easily and can be better incentivized to perform a similar function in another protocol is at risk. In particular protocols that are ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù in functionality and that rely more on their own smart contracts and platform to provide their service over being highly integrated with other projects (possessing stronger network effects) are at higher risk.</p>



<p>Uniswap made such a great target precisely because copying the project is largely as simple as copying its smart contracts, and the main requirement for a successful liquidity platform is sufficient liquidity, which as this whole saga has shown can clearly be (at least temporarily) incentivized.</p>



<p>All done and said, it&#8217;s definitely going to be interesting to watch how SushiSwap and Uniswap continue to co-exist (or not) over the next few months.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Liquidity is paramount to the growth of DeFi. Many DApps require reliable pools of liquidity to function. One of the most interesting project&#8217;s innovating in the pool liquidity space is Balancer. If you haven&#8217;t heard of Balancer, now&#8217;s a great time to learn because Balancer is about to start distributing BAL tokens to liquidity providers on June 1st, 2020 at 00:00 UTC. We&#8217;re working with Balancer Labs to get the word out about this Liquidity Mining process as part of our DeFi Pulse Drop series.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8278" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_hrBWNLyxr4YwrdCnRsfOeQ.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>What is Balancer?</h2>



<p>Balancer is a non-custodial generalized automatic market maker (AMM) protocol that launched in March of this year. Yes, that&#8217;s a mouthful but it&#8217;s easy to understand once you break it down. You&#8217;re probably familiar with AMM exchange models like Uniswap, but where Balancer differs is the fact it&#8217;s generalized making it suitable for all sorts of needs, but more on that in a bit.</p>



<h3>Balancer pools are like self-balancing index funds</h3>



<p>Anyone can create a Balancer pool and add liquidity to the protocol. However, what makes Balancer pools so unique is that you aren&#8217;t restricted to pools with the typical 50/50 split between two tokens we&#8217;re used to. Balancer pools support up to 8 tokens with custom distributions. For example, a pool could be 30% WETH, 30% MKR, and 30% USDC, and 10% LINK while another pool is 80% WETH and 20% DAI. </p>



<p>Balancer uses smart order routing (SOR) to route users&#8217; trades to the pools that combined provide the best rate possible. Essentially, Balancer pools are like self-balancing index funds but instead of charging you fees you actually get paid for contributing your liquidity.</p>



<h3>Different pools for different needs</h3>



<p>As previously mentioned, Balancer liquidity pools are highly flexible and can be optimized for specific use cases. Balancer Labs has even released templates for new innovative pool designs. Take for instance <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/building-liquidity-into-token-distribution-a49d4286e0d4">Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools</a> (LBPs) that communities can use to build deep liquidity for their token. Or even, <a href="https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/zero-impermanent-loss-stablecoin-pool-with-lending-interests-a3da6d8bb782">stablecoin pools with zero impermanent-loss</a>.</p>



<h2>Balancer Protocol Governance Token (BAL)</h2>



<p>Balancer V1 initially launched with no native token; this latest update to Balancer introduces the Balancer Protocol Governance Token (BAL). BAL holders will determine the future of Balancer protocol, making decisions like implementing new features, potential protocol fees, or even bigger picture plans like whether to use layer 2 scaling and/or deploy contracts on other blockchains. </p>



<p>Out of the total supply of 100M BAL tokens, 25M were initially allocated to founders, core devs, advisors and investors and are all subject to vesting periods. The remaining 75M BAL tokens will be mostly distributed to users who provide liquidity to Balancer pools in a process called <strong>liquidity mining</strong>. </p>



<h2>Liquidity mining &#8211; Earn BAL on top of pool returns</h2>



<p>For a protocol like Balancer to remain decentralized, the governance process also needs to be decentralized. And, it only makes sense for those that use the protocol the most to be given a voice in said process. This is exactly what Balancer&#8217;s liquidity mining aims to do. </p>



<p>Each week, 145k BAL will be awarded to users with liquidity in Balancer pools, totaling 7.5M BAL per year. The idea is to create a really strong incentive for early adopters grow liquidity and get involved in the governance process.</p>



<p><strong>Starting on June 1st, 2020 at 00:00 UTC (which is tonight if you&#8217;re reading this Sunday May 31st), those currently providing liquidity to Balancer protocol will be eligible to receive BAL tokens.</strong> So now&#8217;s your chance to <a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/">add liquidity or create a new pool</a> to reap the benefits of being that early adopter.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;All liquidity providers will receive Balancer Protocol Governance Tokens as long as a USD price can be extracted from CoinGecko for at least 2 tokens present in their liquidity pools. Liquidity from tokens without such USD price is not eligible.&#8221;</em></p>



<h3>Earn BAL on top of pool swap fees</h3>



<p>Every Balancer pool has its own customized <em>pool swap fee</em>; whenever someone performs a trade that utilizes the pool&#8217;s liquidity, this fee is distributed equally to that pool&#8217;s liquidity providers. So when you provide liquidity not only are you earning this fee, but you&#8217;re also earning BAL </p>



<h3>Liquidity mining encourages lower pool fees</h3>



<p>One of the coolest parts of liquidity mining is that it&#8217;s designed to incentivize pools to have low pool swap fees. The USD value of each pool&#8217;s underlying tokens according to CoinGecko is multiplied by what&#8217;s called a <em>feeFactor</em> to determine how many BAL the pool is eligible to receive. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="621" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-1024x621.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8277" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-1024x621.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-300x182.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x-768x466.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/1_07aShFlZ136DIIx8ltsWPA@2x.png 1362w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As you can see in the chart above, the higher the fee, the lower this feeFactor is, and the less BAL tokens that pool&#8217;s liquidity providers receive each week. The logic is that pools with lower fees pull in more users willing to trade on Balancer and so these pools should receive greater rewards. Personally, I think it&#8217;s a clever way to optimize Balancer to achieve lower fees while still rewarding liquidity providers accordingly.</p>



<h2>Don&#8217;t miss out. Liquidity mining starts soon.</h2>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t tried it yet, there&#8217;s never been a better time to consider <a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/">adding liquidity to existing pools or creating your own pool</a>. <strong>Starting tonight Sunday 31st (June 1st, 2020 at 00:00 UTC to be precise), those currently providing liquidity to Balancer protocol will be eligible to receive BAL</strong>. Not only will you earn BAL, getting involved early is also a great way to ensure Balancer works best for you, implementing changes you want to see as a stakeholder in the protocol.</p>

<p><em><strong>TLDR: </strong><a href="https://docs.dex.ag/proxy-contract">Integrating DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster with custom fees</a> into your platform provides your users or smart contract with convenient native liquidity while allowing you to build a sustainable business model.</em></p>



<h2>Liquidity is vital for the growth of DeFi</h2>



<p>Users want to experience all DeFi has to offer. But often times to do that you  need to swap between tokens or stablecoins. Liquidity is an important resource that enables DeFi&#8217;s composability and makes it possible for many DApps to function. It&#8217;s the blood that flows through the veins of DeFi. </p>



<p>For a smooth user experience, it&#8217;s essential to have a reliable liquidity at a decent price. DEXes are an obvious choice for reliable liquidity when designing an application or smart contract. However, relying on a single DEX comes with its disadvantages. For example, maybe the token your users want to trade isn&#8217;t listed or has extremely low liquidity causing costly price slippage. </p>



<h3>DeFi is all about having options</h3>



<p>If one DEX isn&#8217;t ideal, The obvious answer is to do what DeFi does best with money legos and combine the awesome powers of DEXes. That&#8217;s why we built our other service DEX.AG, a DEX aggregator. DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster let&#8217;s you trade multiple DEXes and even splits trades across the combination of DEXes that results in the best price. Each DEX has its strengths, the X Blaster combines those strengths and connects users with the DEX or DEXes that best suits their needs. Not to mention, the X Blaster&#8217;s API has a blazing fast response time that delivers available trades within a fraction of a second so users never wait.</p>



<h4>X Blaster <strong>aggregates liquidity from popular DEXes: </strong></h4>



<ul><li>0x v3</li><li>Bancor</li><li>Curve</li><li>Kyber</li><li>Oasis</li><li>Uniswap</li><li>Synthetix<br>&#8230;. and more</li></ul>



<p>With each new update, new tokens, exchanges, and integrations like Compound cTokens and CHAI are added to the X Blaster. We focus on token listings and improving your integrated X Blaster so you can focus on what matters.</p>



<h2>Custom fees enable flexible and sustainable business models</h2>



<p>We built DEX.AG because we understand the power of bringing the community together and the value that can create. We see our proxy contracts with custom fees as an opportunity for teams build sustainable models and grow their communities.</p>



<p>We know how crucial the right business model can be to finding the perfect product-market fit. You choose the custom fees on your X Blaster proxy contract. Developers know their users best and this gives them the flexibility to grow their community on their terms. </p>



<h2>X Blaster in action</h2>

<p><em style=""><b>In this edition of DeFi Dive, Daniel Wang, founder and CEO of Loopring, discusses how zkRollups can scale high-throughput DeFi applications like Loopring.io while </b></em><strong><em>maintaining layer 1 security.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I learned Bitcoin back in 2013 when I was working for JD.com as a senior engineering director. Later I quit JD.com and built a centralized exchange in China, which listed BTC, Ripple, and some other cryptocurrencies. The multiple hacks of exchanges during 2014 &#8211; 2017 made me think about what technicalities can be used to create a better kind of crypto exchanges that can offer much higher security for user assets. </p>



<p>When Ethereum came out, we formed a team to verify a straightforward idea: using smart-contract to build an exchange to trade tokens. We believe a well audited smart-contract exchange should offer the same level of security as the assets. That&#8217;s the beginning of Loopring, but the project ends up with a very different technical solution that we have never imagined.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>Loopring, in its latest version (3.0), is the first zkRollup-based exchange protocol that can settle more than 2K trades per second without sacrificing the layer1 security and incurs less than 200USD per million settlements. We have just started to operate an exchange built on top of this protocol &#8211; the Loopring Exchange, aka Loopring.io. </p>



<p>However, this is not the end of the protocol or the exchange. We are working on versions that will offer better support for onchain composability and easier customization. With the new version, multiple exchanges built on top of the same protocol may have very different DeFi properties and business models. We believe zkRollup is the right solution for scalability, not just for exchanges, but many dApps that are designed to target millions of active users.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>We target people who use centralized exchanges. As of now, DeFi&#8217;s active user base is still very small, and DeFi onboarding is quite challenging for users without a technical background. With our new smart wallet app (launching later this year), we hope to offer a mobile platform for a massive user base with a language they speak and a set of features they can quickly understand. Eventually, security will be part of the minimum requirement a crypto platform shall offer, not a feature that we now talk about so often.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>Loopring 3.5 is something we look forward to, and it will be code-complete very soon. We also expect Loopring Wallet to make a difference in terms of user acquisition.</p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>Orderbook-based exchanges are essential infrastructures for cryptocurrencies, and they fulfill user needs and will remain the dominant form of trading for the massive, even in the future. We believe Loopring is on the right track, and with continuous optimizations and improvements, we will remain competitive and gradually eliminate the centralized exchange technical stack.</p>



<h3>What‚Äôs something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>Serious investors should be concerned with DeFi&#8217;s ever-growing complexity and composability. Our crypto-assets on these products are only as secure as the weakest link in the stack. I do not participate in DeFi aggressively as the return doesn&#8217;t justify the risk for the asset I put in. I&#8217;m not saying we should not participate in DeFi at all, but a wise thing to do is only to invest want we can afford to lose.</p>

<p><strong><em>Loi Luu, Co-Founder and CEO of Kyber Network, spoke with us about his past and the fantastic world of money legos.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>Since I was young I have been interested in programming, particularly in algorithms and data structure. This made me eventually decide to start my undergraduate studies in Computer Science at Vietnam National University in Hanoi and subsequently pursue my PhD at the National University of Singapore. While in Singapore, I came to learn about blockchain technology. My founders and I were amazed at how game-changing blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies were with regards to revolutionizing global payments and transparent finance. </p>



<p>Initially, we worked on the 3 pillars of blockchain technology, namely security (Oyente), decentralization (Smartpool), and scalability (Elastico). The inspiration for Kyber Network came when a project approached us to discuss if it was possible to accept a different token in addition to Ether, with the intention to have common token-holders and community with the other token ecosystem. We were surprised at how hard this seemingly simple problem was. Even for one single cross-token transaction, there were a multitude of problems, ranging from incompatibility (token is different from Ether), finality of the payment (how to check if payment is confirmed), price feeds and so on. This problem gets exacerbated when you have to account for the hundreds of tokens in existence. There was no solution then that addressed this problem in a secure and fully on-chain manner. Our goal, since then, was to facilitate seamless decentralized exchange between different projects and ecosystems. That we thought, might eventually lead to equalizing access to everyone, regardless of origin, location, power or background. </p>



<p>Hence, we developed Kyber Network &#8211; an on-chain protocol for decentralized token exchange in any application. Besides removing key hurdles that hinder the adoption of decentralized technologies, it would give token holders equal access to DApps and services, regardless of which token they hold.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>We are building Kyber Network, a fully on-chain liquidity protocol that enables decentralized exchange of cryptocurrencies in any application, without a need for any intermediary. Since liquidity in the decentralized space is currently scattered, Kyber integrates liquidity providers (Reserves) into one single endpoint for takers (DApps and end users) to easily access. When a taker requests a trade, the protocol will scan the entire network to find the reserve with the best price and take liquidity from that particular reserve. </p>



<p>Kyber‚Äôs fully on-chain design allows for full transparency and verifiability in the matching engine, as well as seamless composability with DApps, all of which are not possible with off-chain or hybrid approaches. The integration of a large variety of liquidity providers also makes Kyber uniquely capable of supporting sophisticated schemes and catering to the various needs of DeFi DApps and financial institutions. Not surprisingly, Kyber is the <a href="https://research.binance.com/analysis/2020-borderless-state-of-defi">most used DeFi protocol in 2019</a>.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>Kyber Network‚Äôs protocol is open source and permissionless, and can be used by any developer, whether you are at a beginner or advanced level. As Kyber is mainly based on Ethereum, developers should ideally have some knowledge of Solidity. You should use Kyber if you are a developer building any kind of DeFi DApp on Ethereum that involves ERC20 token swaps, payments, liquidation, or rebalancing. For KyberSwap, our in-house token swap service, and one of almost 100 DApps using Kyber Network, our ideal customer is an end user that wants to trade and manage ETH and Ethereum tokens in the easiest and most secure way possible.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>We‚Äôre excited about our <a href="https://blog.kyber.network/katalyst-kyber-protocol-upgrade-and-2020-plans-20427ef47ac6">upcoming Katalyst protocol upgrade</a>, which includes the launch of the KyberDAO and a new KNC token model. Katalyst will bring more benefits for stakeholders and DeFi. For instance, reserves will no longer need to hold a KNC balance for fees, removing a major friction point, and there will be rebates for top performing reserves. In addition, integrated DApps can set their own custom fees and create innovative business models, while KNC holders can stake their KNC in the KyberDAO to participate in governance and receive rewards. This is the first time the KNC community will have the ability to vote on key parameters that affect the direction of the Kyber protocol. Katalyst will establish a long term virtuous loop where the success of the DeFi space, growth of the Kyber ecosystem, and value creation for KNC holders go hand in hand.</p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>Kyber aims to be the liquidity layer for the DeFi ecosystem, empowering takers and DApps with a single on-chain endpoint for their liquidity needs and ensuring they receive the best possible rates for each trade. Developers can focus on building and shipping, without needing to worry about liquidity or integrating multiple systems. In general, any DApp that requires on-chain token swaps and is building on DeFi should integrate <a href="https://developer.kyber.network/docs/Start/">Kyber</a> for their liquidity needs!</p>



<h3>What‚Äôs something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>One of the great features of Ethereum open source projects is the concept of composability, where different protocols can be integrated and combined with each other like money legos to create new innovative DeFi use cases. We are very excited about the endless possibilities for value creation and we aim to be the single on-chain endpoint required for the liquidity needs of these use cases. </p>



<p>Some of the interesting DeFi use cases include lending platforms such as Fulcrum and Nuo, asset management protocol Melon, Token Sets by Set protocol, and DEX aggregators like <a href="http://dex.ag/">DEX.ag</a> and 1inch. All these platforms utilize Kyber‚Äôs on-chain protocol for their liquidity needs. Other popular use cases to pay attention to are Flash loans by Aave, Synthetic assets pegged to public stocks and commodities by Synthetix, DeFi insurance by Nexus Mutual, and Real-time money streams by Sablier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s been an amazing year for Decentralized Finance. As of writing this, DeFi has grown from $293M to $665M since the start of 2019. Not only should the community celebrate the tremendous growth this year, but also the many brighter days ahead. Let&#8217;s look to what the future holds for DeFi with four trends you should keep your eyes out for in 2020.</p>
<h3>Privacy Solutions and Mixers</h3>
<p>Research into zero knowledge proof technology was extremely fruitful in 2019. For starters, the gas cost of ZK-SNARKs has greatly been <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-ethereums-istanbul-network-upgrade-affects-defi/">reduced through new EIPs</a>. Not to mention, new ZK proving systems like PLONK, Sonic, etc. are faster than ever. Additionally, EY has continued its work on zero knowledge transaction batching, achieving a 400-fold improvement in gas efficiency.</p>
<p>Aside from the admirable research completed in 2019, many prominent privacy solutions, especially those utilizing ZK-SNARKs, launched new contracts and upgrades onto the mainnet. As with most new technology, testing and audits were necessary for these projects to gain public confidence. For example, Tornado Cash, an ETH mixer using ZK-SNARKs, just <a href="https://twitter.com/TornadoCash/status/1204745639759884289">passed a security audit</a>. Not to mention, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-ethereums-istanbul-network-upgrade-affects-defi/">Istanbul</a> enabled DeFi smart contracts that are interoperable with Zcash. With the steps taken in 2019,&nbsp;expect mixers and other privacy solutions to continue to gain traction in 2020.</p>
<h3>Layer 2 Economics</h3>
<p>Many layer 2 solutions require users to stake or put down a bond for the opportunity to earn protocol fees from layer 2 transactions. Let&#8217;s take a look at <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/what-is-optimistic-rollup-ethereums-latest-layer-2-scaling-solution/">Optimistic rollup</a>&nbsp;as an example which requires bonded aggregators to bundle user-submitted transactions into rollup blocks submitted on their layer 2 sidechains. Users pay aggregators fees to submit their transactions and the new sidechain state root (AKA the optimistic rollup block) to the mainnet.</p>
<p>Anyone can become an aggregator by putting down a bond. Also, anyone can collect rewards for slashing aggregators who submit or build on invalid rollup blocks. We&#8217;re likely to see more solutions like rollups to be deployed in 2020 due to their scaling advantages. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see how the economics behind staking and bonded aggregator mechanics shake out in the year ahead.</p>
<h3>DEXes and DeFi Grow Together Challenging Centralized Exchanges</h3>
<p>In 2020, DEXes will grow as more people are drawn to the unique opportunities available in DeFi. Increasingly efficient non-custodial financial tools will continue to attract more traders away from centralized exchanges. However, it&#8217;s worth noting that most activity in decentralized finance requires liquidity to function.&nbsp;More users, more liquidity necessary to operate. For example, margin trading on <a href="https://defipulse.com/bzx">Fulcrum</a> involves swapping between multiple tokens.</p>
<p>Therefore, incentivizing external and native liquidity is key for DeFi platforms. DEX aggregators like DEX.AG offer users an efficient way to access both, promoting decentralization. A prime example of this is the recent integration of Synthetix&#8217;s native exchange into DEX aggregator&nbsp;<a href="https://dex.ag/susd">DEX.AG</a>. Users of both platforms benefit from the additional liquidity and SNX holders collect more native exchange fees. So keep your eyes on how the relationship between DEXes and DApps evolves in 2020.</p>
<h3>Discovery Period for Staking</h3>
<p>Ethereum 2.0&#8217;s set to launch in early 2020. And so, ETH holders will be able to stake 32 ETH and earn fees for validating blocks. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see how many DeFi users will stake. And based on that, what will the returns be like? How will staking influence the greater DeFi community?</p>
<p>What will be the most popular way to stake ETH and cryptocurrency in general? Exchanges and custody services are already offering Tezos staking and will likely offer custodial ETH staking.</p>
<p>What kind of DeFi products and services will launch to suit the needs of ETH 2.0? For example, <a href="https://www.rocketpool.net/">Rocket Pool</a>&nbsp;is arguably the most popular decentralized staking pool in development. Learn more about the changes coming soon with Ethereum 2.0 <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases/#phase-0-beacon-chain">here</a>.</p>
