<p><strong><em>We spoke with Frontier Co-Founder &amp; Head of Marketing Palash Jain who longs to bring DeFi to the masses with slick features like</em></strong> <strong>TxLink.<em><br></em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I first heard about Ethereum back in 2017, and that&#8217;s where my crypto journey started. Entered into this space out of curiosity and ended up finding the fit in this space. Since then, I have worked with promising start-ups in the space, helping them on the Marketing and the growth end. Now Leading Marketing and Growth at Frontier to bring DeFi to masses.<br></p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>What are you building and what sets it apart? To briefly introduce, Frontier is a mobile-first, user-facing application. Frontier natively integrates multiple DeFi Protocols and wallets, making it super easy for users to Track, View and Manage positions across various DeFi protocols in real-time without having to give away private keys. </p>



<p>Frontier&#8217;s focus is bringing DeFi to Mobile, and that&#8217;s what sets us apart. We offer Native UI/UX for dApps and protocols and native wallet integration on Mobile. To bring wallet composability on mobile we came up with TxLink a middleware which enables Frontier to connect with multiple wallets such that user can choose the preferred wallet to sign transactions, thereby the user never gives away the private key nor has to import wallet. </p>



<p>If we look at the current way of interacting with dApps on Mobile, the experience is slow and sluggish on dApp browsers, and if there&#8217;s a product which offers native integration of dApps, perhaps the user has to create or import wallet onto that App. The user keeps hopping from one app to another app in search of perfect DeFi experience on Mobile. With Frontier, we remove this pain point by giving the user the options to choose existing wallets to transact with and better UI/UX experience.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>Our current users are sophisticated Defi users that are aiming for maximising their returns from their investments in this space. However, what brings Defi users to Frontier is the app simplicity and its user-friendliness, hence everyone&#8217;s invited to make the most of this space. </p>



<p>DeFi is for everyone and so is Frontier.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of exciting stuff which we are working on, our focus for the coming months is to integrate leading DeFi protocols such as MakerDao(Native Vaults module and DSR), Synthetix(Native Mintr), Compound, KAVA. Extend support to more wallets such as Gnosis Safe, Coinbase wallet. Gasless transactions for all DeFi operations via Frontier, and introduce Native staking for PoS and dPos based chains such as Matic Network.<br></p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>Frontier being a user-facing product, aims to bring DeFi to masses! Making it easy for users to access multiple financial protocols giving them the options to choose products based on their risk appetite. DeFi Bank which is open 24/7</p>



<h3>Whatâ€™s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of awesome stuff people are building in this space! Every single day is exciting in DeFi. Folks should look into Ren protocol &#8211; inter-blockchain liquidity for all dApps bringing BTC to Ethereum ecosystem and of course Frontier, every DeFi user must have this App <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[Introducing Interest Per Year, or IPY for short, a new metric created by DeFi Pulse used to track the performance...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Introducing <a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">Interest Per Year</a>, or IPY for short, a new metric created by DeFi Pulse used to track the performance of DeFi lending markets.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine IPY like the speedometer for DeFi measuring the speed at which interest is accruing in DeFi lending protocols given the borrow rate and outstanding debt at that moment. IPY is useful for measuring the potential performance changes of lending protocols in the short term.</span></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s truly fascinating about a metric like IPY is the fact that it isn&#8217;t possible without DeFi.</strong> In centralized finance, banks, financial institutions, and regulators control the flow of information. These authorities choose what information gets disclosed to the public. It&#8217;s not like you can walk into your bank and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m here to perform an audit.&#8221; But things are different with DeFi.</p>
<p>With DeFi, all the data is publicly available on-chain for everyone to see. Transparency and real time data are two major&nbsp;advantages DeFi has gained by rebuilding things from scratch. And it&#8217;s up to us as members of the DeFi community to decide how we want to synthesize the data and utilize those advantages.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7742 size-full" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1.jpg" alt="" width="895" height="645" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1.jpg 895w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1-300x216.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1-768x553.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that DeFi lending is still maturing. Historically, the most popular form of collateral has been ETH. And, the most popular asset to borrow has been DAI. Lending rates have been highly correlated to the performance of this trading pair ETH/DAI. While rates may go up and down, outstanding debts have consistently risen over time. Additionally, as DeFi lending matures and new assets like securities, property, real estate, etc enter the picture, metrics like IPY will mature as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7745 size-full" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="815" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326-300x272.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326-768x695.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>Interest Per Year is an example of what&#8217;s possible through DeFi. It&#8217;s a metric that can help market participants better understand the condition of DeFi lending markets.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, DAI&#8217;s IPY is generally greater than USDC&#8217;s but USDC has a more stable IPY. This indicates that there is greater demand for DAI loans overall but USDC is carving out a niche for steady consistent lending returns.</span></p>
<p>Whether you want to analyze historical rates or simply stay ahead of trends in DeFi, the new&nbsp;<a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">DeFi Lending</a>&nbsp;page makes it easier to spot patterns emerging in the market.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our new page supports a variety of assets including DAI, USDC, ETH, REP, ZRX, WBTC, and BAT with lending data from Compound, Maker, dYdX, and Fulcrum.</span></p>
<h3>Witness the growth of DeFi lending markets firsthand</h3>
<p>Decentralized Finance is still in its infancy. It&#8217;s a historic time for the industry and we&#8217;re about to witness events which will shape DeFi forever. In the days ahead, we&#8217;ll see more and more assets be introduced as collateral in DeFi. Not to mention, different lending models will emerge. And on top of it all, more and more people will experience borrowing or lending in DeFi for the first time. We hope <a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">DeFi Lending</a> will give you the tools to capture history in the making.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a question or feedback about the new Lending page? Let us know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/defipulse">Twitter</a> or in our&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/y7qSf4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord.</a></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is changing the way people interact with their money.Â  However, we know it can be a lot to take in. Don&#8217;t worry, because we&#8217;ve put together this quick guide to give you jump start.</p>
<h2>Start making money on DeFi in 4 steps</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with Ethereum, these steps will only take a few minutes. And when it&#8217;s all said and done, you&#8217;ll be earning interest in DAI every block.Â <em><strong>However if you&#8217;re completely new to Ethereum,</strong></em>Â you may instead want to check outÂ <strong><a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/zero-to-defi-cdai/">Zero to DeFi</a></strong>, a beginner&#8217;s guide which breaks down the entire process of getting a wallet, acquiring ETH, and lending out your DAI.</p>
<h3>1. Get ETH into an address that you own</h3>
<p>As the saying goes, if you don&#8217;t hold the private keys to the wallet, then they aren&#8217;t your coins. So, be sure to perform these steps from a wallet that you hold the private keys to. And, don&#8217;t forget to keep them backed up somewhere safe.</p>
<h3>2. Head toÂ <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> and sell most of that ETH for DAI</h3>
<p><a href="http://DEX.AG/">DEX.AG</a> is a decentralized exchange or DEX aggregator that gets you the best price available from several of the most popular DEXes. It even splits your trade across multiple DEXes if it improves the price, all in one transaction.Â <strong>Make sure to leave a little ETH leftover for <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/what-is-gas/">gas fees</a>.</strong></p>
<h3><a href="https://dex.ag/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7722" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300.jpg 1000w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></h3>
<h3>3. Go to DeFi Pulse&#8217;sÂ <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">Earn Income page</a></h3>
<p>DeFi Pulse is a site where you can find the latest analytics and rankings of DeFi protocols. The DeFi Pulse <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">Earn Income page</a> compares the interest rates you can earn from DeFi lending protocols.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/income"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7715" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-260x300.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="693" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-260x300.jpg 260w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-886x1024.jpg 886w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-768x887.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295.jpg 934w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h3>4. Pick a lending protocol, and start earning interest</h3>
<p>Enter the asset and amount you wish to lend to find which lending protocol has the best interest rate. Pick a protocol and click the &#8216;Next&#8217; button which will redirect you to that app/service. Compound finance is currently the most popular lending protocol. Follow the app&#8217;s instructions to begin lending out your DAI and start earning interest.</p>
<h3>And then later, when you&#8217;re ready to cash out&#8230;</h3>
<p>Head back to the lending protocol you chose and use your private key to unlock the DAI plus interest generated whenever you want. There&#8217;s no &#8220;lock-in&#8221; period or time you have to wait before earning interest. Your DAI is earning interest every block until you choose to stop.</p>
<p><em>Still have questions?Â </em>Come chat us in ourÂ <a href="https://discord.gg/y7qSf4A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a> and stay up-to-date on the world of DeFi by following us on <a href="https://twitter.com/defipulse">Twitter.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Margin trading is extremely popular in the cryptocurrency markets. In the past, traders used to rely on centralized exchanges to trade using leverage. But recently, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-dapp/">DApps</a> that provide this kind of trading have become some of the most popular services in <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi/">DeFi</a>.</p>
<h1>What is margin trading?</h1>
<p>Margin trading is a method of trading using borrowed funds allowing you further leverage your existing assets. <strong>Margin trading comes with higher risks than normal trading.</strong>&nbsp;Because while it does offer the potential to amplify your gains, it can also amplify losses incurred through trading. In traditional finance, brokers typically provide the funds necessary to open a leveraged position. In DeFi, margin traders borrow cryptocurrencies from decentralized lending protocols powered by smart contracts. Lenders<a href="https://defipulse.com/income"> earn interest rates anywhere from 5-20%</a> for lending their tokens to borrowers like margin traders.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>When you open a margin trade, you select your desired amount of leverage and lock in funds (sometimes referred to as collateral) worth a portion of your total order, also known as your margin. Leverage in this case refers to ratio of borrowed assets to the value of your margin. For example, if you opened a margin trade with 3x leverage worth $3,000, you&#8217;d be required to lock in $1,000 worth of collateral.</p>
<p>Margin trading positions can either by long or short. Opening a long position means you believe that the price will go up. Whereas, opening a short position, also known as shorting, means you believe the price of the asset your trading will go down.</p>
<p>To new traders with little collateral, margin trading can be very appealing because it gives you access to more capital. However, you should be aware that trading with leverage multiplies your profits <em>and your losses</em>, meaning that <strong>you should never risk more than you&#8217;re willing to lose</strong>. If the value of your margin falls or the price does not go the way you predicted and your trade becomes over-leveraged, your margin trade can be liquidated and your collateral can be sold to repay the assets you borrowed plus interest.</p>
<h1>Top Margin Trading Platforms in DeFi</h1>
<p>DeFi margin trading platforms are built using smart contracts which enforce trading rules and facilitate the loans between lenders and borrowers, or rather margin traders in this case. When you margin trading cryptocurrency on any of these platforms, you will pay interest on any assets that you borrow. Potential leverage and borrowing interest rates vary from platform to platform. And, the interest you pay is subject to fluctuation depending on the platform&#8217;s available supply and demand for loans.</p>

<h3><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7663" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Selection_224-1024x510.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="319" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Selection_224-1024x510.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Selection_224-300x150.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Selection_224-768x383.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Selection_224-1536x766.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Selection_224-1568x782.jpg 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Selection_224.jpg 1904w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h3>
<h3>Nuo Network</h3>
<p><a href="https://nuo.network/">Nuo Network</a> is the second largest margin trading platform in DeFi with <a href="https://defipulse.com/nuo-network">$10.6 million worth of assets currently locked</a> in its smart contracts.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The internet has evolved over time to become a vital part of our daily lives. Web3 marks the next evolution of the internet where websites, applications, or services are controlled by their users. When you see the phrase &#8220;Web3 compatible&#8221; this often means that the website or service interacts with the Ethereum network. If you&#8217;re new to all this, it&#8217;s certainly a bit confusing. So, to better understand it&#8217;s easier if we take a look back at how we got here.</p>
<p>In the early days of the internet, websites had limited functionality. Users mainly consumed content from websites. Maybe you had a personal web page but it was static. And, it was hosted by your ISP or a site like GeoCities. There was little interactivity except for maybe a guestbook where users could leave their name and a brief comment.</p>
<h3>Web 2.0: The rise of social media</h3>
<p>Next came Web 2.0 as some would call it. This era saw a notable shift towards user participation. Social media sites like MySpace, Facebook, YouTube, etc. became the norm. Before long, the majority of content was being generated by the users of a website. However, these users don&#8217;t control the content they create. Websites host their content for them. And so, users are expected to abide by their terms of service (ToS) or they&#8217;ll get the boot. Not to mention, the website can change their ToS at anytime forcing the user to agree or be cut off from the service and, in some circumstances, their own data.</p>

<h3>Web3: Giving the power back to the people</h3>
<p>Web 2.0 relies on users to create the value which the owner or host can reap the benefits from. In most cases, you have little to no control over your data. Also, you never know if the content you enjoy will stick around. When content is no longer needed or threatens profits, the host of the website or service has the right to remove it from their platform leaving you high and dry. Not to mention, most service providers own your data under their terms of service. Web3 seeks to empower users and to recapture the value that they create.</p>
<p>Web3 applications, sometimes referred to as <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-dapp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DApps</a>, are built on decentralized peer-to-peer networks like <a href="https://concourseopen.com/blog/what-is-ethereum/">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://ipfs.io/">IPFS</a>. Instead of being run by some company, these networks are built, operated, and maintained by their users. They&#8217;re self-organizing and lack a central point of failure. Additionally, they&#8217;re open-source meaning anyone&#8217;s help to build upon this shared infrastructure. Products and services that are &#8220;web3 compatible&#8221; have the ability to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Smart contracts are like pieces of code that run on the Ethereum blockchain. Once launched, they operate as programmed and users can rely on them to be unstoppable and censorship-resistant. Web3 is the future of the internet that treats it like the shared infrastructure it is. It&#8217;s a future where everyone can contribute value to the internet and be rewarded for it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized application (DApp) commonly refers to an application built on top of the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts.</p>
<p>The exact definition of DApp can be hard to pin down because things change so quickly. But, the term DApp can be loosely defined by the qualities that decentralized applications share.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7603 aligncenter" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DFP-DApp-img-1-300x208.png" alt="" width="475" height="330" /></h2>
<h2>Decentralized applications come in many different flavors</h2>
<p>DApps come in many shapes and sizes, but they all have a few things in common. For example, most DApps are open source. Smart contracts serve as the code behind decentralized applications running on the Ethereum blockchain. Meaning DApp users aren&#8217;t required to sign up or create a login, but instead interact with the application directly on the blockchain. Also, this means that decentralized applications are often unstoppable, uncensorable, and users&#8217; data and interactions are permanent.</p>
<p>In some cases, decentralized applications interact with the world outside of the Ethereum blockchain. These DApps require information provided by an <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-an-oracle-how-smart-contracts-see-the-world/">oracle</a> to operate. For example, <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MakerDAO</a> currently relies on price feeds from several exchanges to determine the price of DAI or when to liquidate <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-cdp/">CDP</a>s.</p>
<p>Some DApps have their own peer-to-peer networks built on top of Ethereum which enhance or extend the functions of their underlying smart contracts. For example, <a href="https://0x.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0x</a> protocol&#8217;s network of relayers instantly relay trade orders which are later settled on-chain. While others, use other peer-to-peer networks like <a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPFS</a> to host content or even their frontend interface.</p>
<h4>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is the fastest growing category of DApp.</h4>
<p>While not every DApp involves money, most of them do. And by far, the most popular DApps provide finance products or services on the Ethereum blockchain. Just to name a few types of DApps in DeFi: <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/earn-income/">lending</a>, <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange/">DEXes</a>, tokenized assets, payment solutions, insurance, etc. Learn more about <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/what-is-defi/">DeFi</a> and the most <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-on-ethereum/">popular DeFi applications</a>.</p>
<h3>DApps and their users make smart contracts bigger than the sum of their parts</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, not every DApp falls into the DeFi category. For example, DApps can be games like trading cards and collectibles with ownership stored on the blockchain.Â Other DApps form social networks using Ethereum accounts as logins and decentralized storage like IPFS to host user generated content.</p>
<p>Another common form of DApp is a DAO or decentralized autonomous organization. DAOs are like companies or organizations without a leader. They can govern the way smart contracts or DeFi protocols operate. Some DAOs even tokenize ownership and share profits like a company.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve only skimmed the surface of what many might consider a DApp. But like we said, the world of decentralized applications is changing everyday. Each new project or innovation adds to the ecosystem and affects what can be defined as a DApp.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smart contracts exist on the blockchain and can only access data available on-chain. They rely on what&#8217;s called an oracle to interact with real world, or off-chain, data. An oracle is a source of data that is being fed to a smart contract. For example, oracles provide data like the price of a stock, weather data like temperatures, or even the outcome of a sporting event.</p>
<h3>Oracles are divided into two categories: software and hardware.</h3>
<p>Software oracles relay information to smart contracts from the digital world outside the Ethereum blockchain. This information comes from online sources like websites, backend APIs, or even other smart contracts. Weather data, stock prices, flight schedules, sporting event results, etc are all common examples of information software oracles can provide.</p>
<p>Hardware oracles use equipment to inform smart contracts what&#8217;s happening in the physical world. Hardware oracles often utilize Internet of things, or IoT, devices. These devices track and verify real world data before sending it to the smart contract. Common examples include thermometers, supply chain RFID tags, GPS data, etc.</p>
<h3>Oracles have their ups and downs</h3>
<p>While oracles enable new possibilities for smart contracts, they also introduce potential risks. Smart contracts trust the information given to them by oracles. And, this data is often critical to how the smart contract functions. What would happen if an attacker hijacking the data feed? Or, what if the source of information simply malfunctions? Consequently, Developers have to take these risks into consideration when designing oracles. Decentralizing oracles across multiple sources of data helps mitigate some of these risks.</p>
