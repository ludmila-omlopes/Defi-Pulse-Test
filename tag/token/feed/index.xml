										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Over the course of 2020, more than 140,000 BTC entered the DeFi ecosystem. With so many different alternatives for Bitcoin tokens, it only makes sense to break it out into its own page to provide more detailed metrics. We&#8217;re excited to introduce a new page highlighting the use of Bitcoin in the DeFi ecosystem. <a href="http://defipulse.com/btc">Bitcoin at Work</a> measures the total amount of BTC being utilized within decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="http://defipulse.com/btc"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-1024x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8793" width="512" height="512" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-1024x1024.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-150x150.png 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1-768x768.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-at-work-thumb-1.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>We worked with 10 different teams from all across our industry to bring you a wide variety of BTC token metrics. <strong>The following BTC tokens will be included at launch:&nbsp;WBTC, RENBTC, HBTC, sBTC, tBTC, imBTC, oBTC, acBTC, pBTC, and BTC++.</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-1024x512.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8785" width="768" height="384" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-1024x512.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-300x150.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03-768x384.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/btc-logo-board03.png 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<p>As you might have noticed, WBTC has been moved to this new page and its TVL is no longer included in the TVL metrics found on our homepage. WBTC was originally added to the leaderboard at a time when it was practically the only tokenized BTC utilized in DeFi, but given the current landscape we now think it is a better fit for the Bitcoin at Work leaderboard.</p>



<p>We know that not every BTC token is quite the same. Each one has its own method of minting and redeeming and varying degrees of centralization ranging from custodial to fully decentralized.<strong> </strong><br><strong>We broke down each BTC token into four types to better distinguish their different qualities:<br></strong><br><strong>Decentralized</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held within a fully decentralized protocol<br><br><strong>Custodial</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held in custody by a third party<br><br><strong>Synthetic</strong> &#8211; a token which follows the price of Bitcoin but is not directly backed by BTC<br><br><strong>Hybrid</strong> &#8211; a BTC token backed by BTC held within an open protocol transitioning towards decentralization</p>



<p>Aside from recognizing the hard work and growth of this sector, we hope the metrics and information included in this new page will help DeFi users discover new possibilities and make more informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Special thanks to all the teams for working with us! Be sure to check out the new page and explore the <a href="http://defipulse.com/btc">Bitcoin at Work</a> metrics for yourself. And if you’re interested in joining the DeFi Pulse Leaderboard, please check out this <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/how-to-join-the-defi-pulse-leaderboard/">step-by-step guide.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Let’s face it&#8230; In the heat of the moment when it matters most you want to be using the fastest, cheapest way to execute that critical trade. And when you trade on most DEXes, network congestion and the subsequent high gas fees impact your performance. Pay too low of a gas price and you’ll be stuck waiting around, sometimes only to have your transaction revert. So, your other option is to crank up the gas price and pay gas fees which add up over time, eating into your profits.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These limitations can lead to a less-than-desirable experience for traders, especially those coming from centralized exchanges. Over the past few years, countless hours of research have gone into creating layer 2 technologies that allow DeFi applications like DEXes to scale far beyond what’s possible on layer 1. DeversiFi has made it their mission to provide a professional trading platform for traders as the first exchange on Ethereum to adopt StarkWare’s Validium Rollups Layer 2 scaling technology.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>DeversiFi in a nutshell</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.deversifi.com/"><strong>DeversiFi</strong></a><strong> is a self-custodial layer 2 DEX capable of processing up to 9000 transactions per second by utilizing zero-knowledge transaction batching technology. </strong>The next chapter for DeversiFi and the Nectar ecosystem begins soon with the launch of Nectar Beehive V1, a liquidity mining initiative designed to further bootstrap the Nectar community and produce sustainable, long-term liquidity for the NEC ecosystem.</p>



<h1>The Evolution of DeversiFi</h1>



<p>When you hear the term ‘liquidity mining’ you probably think of fly-by-night food token farms, however NEC, the token of the DeversiFi ecosystem, is in a category of its own. DeversiFi and the Nectar ecosystem have been pioneers of <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/introducing-the-nectar-token-58ba40e5419a/">liquidity mining in the DeFi space since 2017</a> and are backed by notable partners such as ParaFi Capital, D1 Ventures, BR Capital, StarkWare, Bitfinex, ConsenSys, and Infura.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Originally <a href="https://www.bitfinex.com/posts/279">incubated by Bitfinex</a> (now fully independent), DeversiFi began as Ethfinex Trustless, a decentralized exchange with a hybrid infrastructure with deep-liquidity from aggregated order books which access liquidity from exchanges like Bitfinex. <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/introducing-the-nectar-token-58ba40e5419a/">Nectar (NEC) was introduced in 2017</a> as one of the first liquidity mining tokens as a way to reward Ethfinex users with a stake in the future development, governance and success of the platform. Ethfinex eventually closed its doors in August 2019 leaving behind 17000 ETH which was entrusted to NEC holders via the Nectar DAO, or NecDAO for short.&nbsp;</p>



<h1>Piecing together DeversiFi, NEC, and NecDAO</h1>



<p>Nectar’s original purpose was to incentivize liquidity on Ethfinex offering 50% of the centralized exchange’s trading fees. But after Ethfinex closed its doors, the remaining 17,000 ETH was passed onto the Nectar DAO and <a href="https://nectar.community/whitepaper">the role of NEC tokens has since expanded</a> to become the governance and utility token of the Nectar and DeversiFi ecosystem. The primary goal of Nectar is to grow the world’s largest community of decentralized exchange users. NEC tokens can be staked to earn reputation and become a voting member of NecDAO. Learn more about <a href="https://nectar.community/dao">Nectar DAO</a>.</p>



<p>NEC is deflationary with the supply being reduced over time through a buy-and-burn model. Each week, up to 50% of the revenue from DeversiFi trading fees (based on daily trading volumes) are used to purchase NEC tokens through an open and transparent auction mechanism. These NEC tokens are then burned reducing the total supply.</p>



<p>DeversiFi offers unique trading fee discounts to NEC token holders. On top of the trading fee discounts DeversiFi users receive based on their 30d trading volume, Nectar holders will soon be entitled to additional discounts of up to 20% depending on the average amount of Nectar tokens that they hold (and have locked inside DeversiFi) for the past 30 days. For example, if a trader expects to do 10 million USD of trading volume every 30 days, buying and holding 100,000 NEC could save them ~$4000 in fees per 30 days.</p>



<p>You can see how DeversiFi and NecDAO have a symbiotic relationship. The more users trade on DeversiFi, the more NEC tokens are burned, the more valuable NEC becomes, the greater the value of the potential discounts NEC holders can receive. NecDAO and NEC holders benefit from generating proposals which improve DeversiFi and attract more trading volume. DeversiFi, in turn, has a dedicated community of NEC stakeholders that boost trading volumes and generally promote their platform.</p>



<h1>Introducing Beehive, Nectar’s new liquidity mining initiative<img loading="lazy" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/AEwu1MgeUK5S0tl0uXQodikfIOanlcWYVuse6Q0MkTmU9aiFDKMarX9s6vMtzaK1eXFSeyBU7p17Q0aAKtFmA6dYlSWSIR3tU3XV-KAkfWxi51od7v-bKYvk7AIGsIhGKiMsljo1" width="624" height="324"></h1>



<p>Nectar Beehive V1 is a new community bootstrapping and liquidity mining initiative for the DeversiFi ecosystem that returns NEC to its roots of rewarding market makers.</p>



<p>Nectar Beehive will allow liquidity providers to stake their tokens and earn NEC and BAL token rewards, offering multipliers up to 2x for those who also trade on DeversiFi. Of course, APY varies and is subject to many factors such as the price of NEC tokens and total participation in Nectar Beehive. Inspired by other popular liquidity mining initiatives, NEC rewards will be&nbsp; vested for 1 year, limiting sell pressure on the market and producing a sustainable source of liquidity for NEC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nectar Beehive V1 officially launches on Tuesday December 1st, 2020. All the need-to-know details will be communicated in their <a href="https://discord.gg/GMtnTZeHpr">Discord</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/deversifi">Twitter</a>. UPDATE: <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/nectar-liquidity-mining/">Learn more about Nectar Beehive V1</a>.</p>



<h1>DeversiFi offers a fast, smooth trading experience</h1>



<p>We recommend you <a href="https://www.deversifi.com/">experience it for yourself</a> to see how it compares to what you’ve come to expect from a DEX or even centralized exchanges. DeversiFi have recently added Hermez Network token offering a 10% kickback to the first 100 users who trade HEZ (<a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/hez-token-now-available-on-deversifi/">details here</a>). In the run-up to Nectar Beehive, various new token pairs will be added allowing Beehivers to trade their favourite tokens while earning NEC.</p>



<h2>High throughput and deep liquidity</h2>



<p>Why are rollups so cool? I’m glad you asked. I’m not going to get into all the technical details of how zkSTARKs or Validium rollups work. But in a nutshell, they allow DeversiFi to offer a super fast layer 2 experience while still rooting all security in layer 1, in this case the Ethereum blockchain. DeversiFi was the first DEX to utilize StarkWare’s transaction batching technology StarkEx which processes and settles trades at extremely high speeds (approx. 9,000 tps).</p>



<p>DeversiFi’s hybrid infrastructure features allows traders to tap into deep liquidity from aggregated order books including Bitfinex, resulting in self-custodial access to the best prices.</p>



<h2>Gas-Free trading</h2>



<p>No one likes paying high gas fees. They always seem to spike when you need to make an important trade. This typically happens because many traders are competing to “outbid” other traders to be included in the next block. <strong>DeversiFi users enjoy gas-free trading with instant finality</strong> thanks to its Validium rollups. Trades are processed in batches and securely submitted back to the Ethereum blockchain where customers’ funds are held. There is never any danger of trades being rolled back and rooting the transactions on-chain ensures customers would be able to withdraw their funds in the unlikely case where DeversiFi or StarkWare go offline.</p>



<p>Gas fees are only required to lock and unlock tokens; this is because these interactions take place with DeversiFi’s smart contract on layer 1.</p>



<h2>Privacy-by-default</h2>



<p>Don’t leak that sweet sweet alpha. Validium rollups is one of the only layer 2 technologies on the market that enables private transactions. Privacy let’s you make the most of opportunities in the market without exposing your strategy to the public blockchain where it can be monitored and reverse-engineered. And while leaking alpha is bad, your data potentially falling into more nefarious hands is worse.</p>



<p>Don’t underestimate the value of privacy when it comes to DeFi. Although the community is small now, DeFi is likely to grow into a wider mainstream market where bad actors may increasingly look to take advantage of personal data stored forever on the blockchain. As the saying goes: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.</p>



<h1>DeversiFi’s roadmap aims to uniquely position the platform for the future</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/21xwQM4KCgKndacOHO9kIz_maga7Vzgs9-iIixBnsvt8iOB_yU7gblPBPY6sGC83NiaVwveE3PPmh-F10UeJ83-PPpop0dwIcGnn9LYmSeEGhGxWFR9btYjQRgp4Lr7g7rUpbL_C" alt=""/></figure>



<p><a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/deversifi-public-roadmap/"></a></p>



<p>Composability between platforms is the major game changer of DeFi. Within the next few months, DeFi is likely to experience an explosive growth in the number of protocols available on layer 1 in addition to the new and existing services migrating to layer 2. DeversiFi’s hybrid architecture and history of adaptation makes it uniquely situated to capitalize on the potential composability between layer 1 and layer 2 platforms as well as the opportunities that arise from bridging decentralized and centralized services like CEXs/DEXs.</p>



<p>Let’s discuss some features coming up on DeversiFi’s roadmap. Head <a href="https://blog.deversifi.com/deversifi-public-roadmap/">here</a> for a full public roadmap.</p>



<h2>Rapid Withdrawals and DeversiFi EARN</h2>



<p>I haven’t met a person yet who enjoys the agony that is waiting for a withdrawal from an&nbsp; exchange. Previously, DeversiFi users would be required to wait until another batch of transactions is submitted to the blockchain in order to withdraw their funds. This can sometimes take a few hours depending on network congestion. With new rapid withdrawal functionality, DeversiFi users will be able to withdraw instantly, paying a fee and essentially “borrowing” liquidity from the DeversiFi EARN pool. Users can provide liquidity to DeversiFi EARN to earn fees for enabling rapid withdrawals. Both parties benefit from the arrangement: liquidity providers earn passive returns and traders have the option to skip the wait for a convenience fee.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Conditional transfers open the door for enhanced composability</h2>



<p>Beyond fast withdrawals, conditional transfers open the door to many new possibilities and arbitrage opportunities for DeversiFi users. This upgrade would allow users to withdraw to new or different addresses, deposit from one address directly into their DeversiFi trading account, and it can even allow traders to make custom transactions directly interacting with other DeFi protocols on layer 1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can imagine how this lowers the opportunity cost of holding funds in DeversiFi. DeversiFi users benefit from being positioned to effectively seize potential opportunities across centralized and decentralized layer 1 and layer 2 DEXes, improving the overall efficiency of the market.</p>



<h2>Exploring synergies between DeFi and centralized services</h2>



<p>DeversiFi has been exploring a number of things that would further enhance DeversiFi’s hybrid architecture including zero-knowledge KYC and several regulatory licenses that would allow them to provide regulated products such as derivatives and leverage to even traders based out of the United States.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>DeversiFi has put a lot of time and effort into building a very uniquely situated trading platform. When you put all the pieces together, it’s easy to see DeversiFi and the Nectar community are dedicated to building a platform that is sustainable with long-term goals. Experience what layer 2 has to offer today by trading on <a href="https://www.deversifi.com/">DeversiFi</a>. And don’t forget to mark your calendar for the launch of <a href="https://beehive.nectar.community/#/beehive">Beehive</a>! Thanks for reading.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DeFi projects exist on a spectrum of decentralization. Trustlessness is at the heart of decentralization. But the word ‘trustlessness’ in itself is almost an oxymoron because trust is almost never eliminated from the equation but instead is simply shifted from one counterparty to another. The goal is to minimize the required trust in the pursuit of trustlessness. Even our most trustless examples of smart contracts still require a certain amount of trust that the blockchain infrastructure it is built on will continue to function properly. Additionally, there are internal economic and smart contract security risks in DeFi platforms themselves. Looking beyond that, DeFi platforms face external risks like composability with other protocols and even further out is oracle integrity and off-chain infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Adding complexity typically comes with a wider attack surface for smart contracts. Many recent hacks have been caused by oracle manipulation. By simplifying the process of non-custodial asset management, you’re able to limit the attack surface of the average user. This is the guiding principle of DEXTF, permissionless non-custodial oracle-less fund management infrastructure. <a href="http://dextf.com/">DEXTF</a> enables digital-native funds where two parties, the portfolio manager and the investor, which are mutually distrusting of each other can cryptographically verify the status of the funds and enforce their rights directly through a digital wallet.</p>



<h1>What is DEXTF?</h1>



<p>DEXTF is an asset management protocol that allows anyone to create, mint, and redeem XTF funds. At present, DEXTF <a href="https://docs.dextf.com/documentation/faq/supported-tokens">supports 44 different assets</a> and funds are soft-limited to 10 tokens although this limit can be changed. The ticker symbol and asset weights are determined by the fund manager when creating the fund. Each XTF fund is an ERC20 token with its own address and contract allowing users to hold, trade, redeem and utilize XTF fund tokens like any other token.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-300x288.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8694" width="300" height="288" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-300x288.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-1024x985.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-768x738.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-1536x1477.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-2048x1969.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/11/DEXTF-logo-1568x1508.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>



<h1>What makes DEXTF unique?</h1>



<p>The DEXTF team spotted a gap in the DeFi ETF space for an easy, accessible way for anyone to create and manage funds in DeFi. They sought to create simple and efficient asset management infrastructure that followed the team’s philosophy that only the bare minimum of logic should be on chain. DEXTF does not rely on oracles. The risk of manipulation present in complex oracle or rebalancing mechanisms tends to result in the use of admin keys in order to respond in a timely manner to attacks or exploits. The DEXTF team is skeptical that any protocol with these mechanisms can truly eliminate the need for these admin keys and subsequently the risk of capture these keys pose to the protocol. With DEXTF, there are no oracles to manipulate that can be used to steal or drain the fund; XTFs can only be minted with or redeemed for their underlying weight of tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DEXTF simply provides a permissionless way to mint new XTF tokens and relies solely on arbitrage and market forces for fund pricing. While only so much logic can be programmed into a smart contract, a community of properly incentivized stakeholders can be the strongest and smartest solution to many problems. Ultimately, reducing ETFs to their simplest form makes XTFs simpler to utilize in a way that is reminiscent of the highly modular design philosophy of UNIX. DEXTF can almost be thought of as a trust-minimized set of building blocks that creates economic incentives and opportunities for the community to be rewarded for taking up each role in the ecosystem.</p>



<h1>How the DEXTF ecosystem functions</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-coin-jigsaw-2@140x140-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8649" width="140" height="140"/></figure></div>



<p>Let’s break down the four roles in the DEXTF ecosystem to understand how they fit together to create highly liquid XTF token funds that are redeemable for their underlying assets. Investors, fund managers, and liquidity providers are eligible to receive ecosystem rewards for participating but we’ll cover that more later on. The team is also planning to add rewards for arbitrageurs.</p>



<h2>Investors</h2>



<p>Those looking to invest in XTF fund tokens can buy existing fund tokens listed on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap. Alternatively, you can mint more XTF fund tokens by providing the underlying tokens although this costs more in gas fees. If you do not have them already, you can purchase the required tokens from Kyber right inside the <a href="https://dapp.dextf.com/">DEXTF interface</a> after selecting your desired fund. I recommend taking a look at DEXTF’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nU7ZrFqjWlPT1AYbdx4mYcT84wLy8jmv/view">video tutorials</a> to see how the fund investment process works.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://dapp.dextf.com/"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_450-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8662" width="768" height="432"/></a></figure></div>



<h2>Fund Managers</h2>



<p>The process of creating XTF funds is designed to be simple and self-service. The idea is to promote decentralization by giving anyone the ability to freely and easily <a href="https://dapp.dextf.com/">create funds with idle tokens</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Anyone can create a fund in 4 easy steps:</strong></p>



<ol><li>Click the ‘Create Fund’ button and select your fund’s name and ticker symbol</li><li>Select which assets to include in your fund and the weight of each asset</li><li>Assign a risk rating and add a description to your fund</li><li>Finally, launch your fund on the blockchain</li></ol>



<p>Yet again, I recommend taking a look at DEXTF’s <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nU7ZrFqjWlPT1AYbdx4mYcT84wLy8jmv/view">video tutorials</a> to see for yourself how it works.</p>



<p>As of this writing, fund managers are currently able to choose from <a href="https://docs.dextf.com/documentation/faq/supported-tokens">44 different assets</a> with a soft limit of 10 assets wrapped around a single XTF token fund (this limit can be changed) but the DEXTF team plans to gradually expand the list of supported assets. You’ll even be able to create a fund consisting of other XTF fund tokens eventually. The DEXTF team also plans to continue adding new features like fund management fees and new asset types including real world assets such as equity, debt, and options.</p>



<h2>Liquidity Providers</h2>



<p>In order for new investors to be able to purchase XTF funds from a DEX, existing XTF fund token holders must provide liquidity. Fund managers and investors can take newly minted XTF tokens and create a pool on Uniswap to earn trading fees and liquidity mining rewards. Liquidity providers are important for ensuring smaller investors can efficiently enter and exit XTF funds while arbitrageurs are able to effectively take advantage of opportunities to drive XTF fund prices in the market.</p>



<h2>Arbitrageurs</h2>



<p>As previously mentioned, DEXTF’s oracle-less design relies on market forces to fairly price XTF funds. When the price of an XTF fund token differs from the value of its underlying assets, it’s up to arbitrageurs to seize the opportunity, balancing out price inefficiencies in the market. For example, an arbitrageur that spots an XTF token that is overvalued on Uniswap can provide the underlying tokens to mint and sell new XTF tokens. This action rewards the arbitrageur with profit for keeping the XTF fund properly priced and also pays trading fees to the pool’s liquidity providers. Arbitrageurs are vital to the DEXTF ecosystem because they indirectly provide price information to the protocol through their actions which eliminates the need for the oracle. To reward their participation, DEXTF is planning to provide ecosystem rewards to arbitrageurs soon.</p>



<h1>DEXTF Governance Token and Ecosystem Rewards</h1>



<p>DEXTF is an ERC20 token created to govern the DEXTF protocol. DEXTF tokens can be used to vote on proposals for potential protocol changes including the adjustment of system parameters like management fee factors or interest rate algorithms. DEXTF holders may also delegate their voting power to another address or delegate who may propose, vote on, and execute proposals on their behalf.</p>



<p>Additionally, the distribution of DEXTF tokens has been designed to reward network participants for performance, liquidity, volume and other interesting metrics in an effort to increase adoption of the DEXTF Dapp and XTF token funds.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/hVAdkELzRHVejxtxsGI9rRL0GfjKZbQq9IA2jpw2sV-1fR-7CyNr4OdJ7ODtftRPn4QBzRHmTdkhqIQ2UuIunExFcexO9S9p4tzIPIINxjDDcQ1zaDEaO2KpbBsYUsD0hme14Grc" width="624" height="348"></p>



<h2>DEXTF Rewards</h2>



<p>DEXTF Rewards fall into three categories: Monthly Incentive Program (for Fund Managers and Investors), Milestone-based Incentive Program (for Fund Managers) and Liquidity Mining Incentive Program (for any user). These rewards are to be distributed over a 5 year period to encourage long-term adoption.<br><br>Users are eligible to receive DEXTF rewards for performing the following actions:</p>



<h3>Launch a new XTF fund token&nbsp;</h3>



<p>You can receive DEXTF tokens for launching new XTF fund tokens by selecting the underlying assets and relative weights. 17,000,000 DEXTF tokens or 17% of the total supply is reserved for monthly incentives for being one of the top funds, top new funds, and top performing new funds.</p>



<p>5,000,000 DEXTF or 5% of the total supply is set aside for Milestone Incentives, more specifically for the first funds to cross certain milestones. Learn more details about <a href="https://medium.com/dextf/intro-to-dextf-tokenomics-and-governance-aa0b620d959d">DEXTF incentives</a>.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that when you take your idle tokens and launch your own fund, you’re competing to win a ratio of DEXTF rewards relative to the total. You can find the list of supported tokens <a href="https://docs.dextf.com/documentation/faq/supported-tokens">here</a>.</p>



<h3>Minting of XTF fund tokens</h3>



<p>You can receive DEXTF tokens for either minting XTF fund tokens via in kind contribution of the underlyings or through KyberSwap (except for tokens that are currently not supported by Kyber itself in which case a link to Paraswap will be provided to secure the missing tokens). 3,000,000 DEXTF or 3% of the total supply is set aside for Investors’ Monthly Incentives. The top 20 investors are eligible to receive a share of these rewards each month.</p>



<h3>Liquidity Mining</h3>



<p>You can receive DEXTF tokens for providing liquidity to the whitelisted Uniswap pools with XTF pairings. Out of the total  25,000,000 of all DEXTF tokens reserved for liquidity miners, 30% of it are reserved for the DEXTF/ETH pool LPs while the remaining 70% or 17,500,000 DEXTF are distributed across all other pools proportionally to the size of each pool in USDT terms. You can contact the DEXTF team at <a href="mailto:request@dextf.com">requests@dextf.com</a> to request a pool be whitelisted.</p>



<h3>Distribution Schedule</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="140" height="140" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-hourglass-coins@140x140.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8653"/></figure></div>



<p>Monthly Incentive Program rewards are streamed daily to a unique smart contract, starting from the end of term plus 1 day. Terms start on 15th of the month and ends on the 14th of following month. DEXTF liquidity mining rewards are streamed every block. Reward tokens are claimable in full only after 30 days. Liquidity providers receive a 10% bonus reward in DEXTF for staying for the full term.</p>



<p>For example, let’s say you started providing liquidity on November 15th and continued to do so for one month (so until December 14th), then you would only fully receive the rewards for that month of providing liquidity until January 15th, 2021.</p>



<p>See here for the <a href="https://medium.com/dextf/liquidity-mining-program-update-bca33057befe">latest update regarding the liquidity mining program</a>.</p>



<h1>What’s next for DEXTF?</h1>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-saving-increase-2@140x140-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8651"/></figure></div>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/dextf/what-are-structured-tokens-introducing-dexsts-b87474cba078">Decentralized Structured Tokens</a> (DEXSTs) are hybrid tokens with adjustable risk-return profiles, better suited to express non-linear market views. DEXSTs can utilize yield generating assets, derivatives, synthetics, and options from many different DeFi projects. Incorporating these sophisticated assets allows DEXSTs to take advantage of more opportunities in the market and allows their creators to adjust the risk-return profile to cater to a variety of market views.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Capital Protected Structured Token (CPST)</h2>



<p>The first Decentralized Structured Token (DEXST) is a <a href="https://medium.com/dextf/what-are-structured-tokens-introducing-dexsts-b87474cba078">Capital Protected Structured Token (CPST)</a> for ETH.&nbsp; As the name implies, Capital Protected Structured Tokens attempt to protect you from potential downside to your capital, ETH in this case, while maintaining exposure to the potential upside. CPSTs can be designed to be anti-fragile, suitable for any market conditions potentially performing best when the market is volatile in a range-bound market.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"> <img class="wp-image-8660" style="width: 140px;" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-bear-market-1@140x140-1.png" alt=""><img class="wp-image-8659" style="width: 140px;" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/streamline-icon-bull-market-1@140x140-1.png" alt=""></p>



<p>The first iteration of CPST was launched in late September 2020. In the time since, the DEXTF team has worked with Opyn and UMA to incorporate feedback from the first iteration to co-build the next iteration of the primitive which could generate sustainable liquidity making it attractive to buyers. New CPSTs will be using UMA’s Zero-Coupon Bonds, a longer maturity version of the yield dollar, and a longer maturity Opyn call option with June 2021 expiry. The idea is to create a floor value of sorts for the underlying ETH but still allow investors to participate in any upside. So if you’re bullish but don’t want to remain fully exposed, CPSTs offer an efficient way to invest.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>The DEXTF team has built simple yet sophisticated fund management infrastructure that anyone can take advantage of to manage their portfolio. The permissionless and oracle-less design of DEXTF makes it highly scalable and resistant to capture or manipulation. DEXTF is also working in partnership with many prominent members of the DeFi community such as Opyn, UMA, Kyber, Ren Alliance, Set Protocol, and so many more to expand their already flexible set of components. All the necessary components and incentives are there for any community member to build or participate in an efficient ecosystem around digital-native funds and be rewarded for doing so.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><em><strong>TLDR: </strong><a href="https://docs.dex.ag/proxy-contract">Integrating DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster with custom fees</a> into your platform provides your users or smart contract with convenient native liquidity while allowing you to build a sustainable business model.</em></p>



<h2>Liquidity is vital for the growth of DeFi</h2>



<p>Users want to experience all DeFi has to offer. But often times to do that you  need to swap between tokens or stablecoins. Liquidity is an important resource that enables DeFi&#8217;s composability and makes it possible for many DApps to function. It&#8217;s the blood that flows through the veins of DeFi. </p>



<p>For a smooth user experience, it&#8217;s essential to have a reliable liquidity at a decent price. DEXes are an obvious choice for reliable liquidity when designing an application or smart contract. However, relying on a single DEX comes with its disadvantages. For example, maybe the token your users want to trade isn&#8217;t listed or has extremely low liquidity causing costly price slippage. </p>



<h3>DeFi is all about having options</h3>



<p>If one DEX isn&#8217;t ideal, The obvious answer is to do what DeFi does best with money legos and combine the awesome powers of DEXes. That&#8217;s why we built our other service DEX.AG, a DEX aggregator. DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster let&#8217;s you trade multiple DEXes and even splits trades across the combination of DEXes that results in the best price. Each DEX has its strengths, the X Blaster combines those strengths and connects users with the DEX or DEXes that best suits their needs. Not to mention, the X Blaster&#8217;s API has a blazing fast response time that delivers available trades within a fraction of a second so users never wait.</p>



<h4>X Blaster <strong>aggregates liquidity from popular DEXes: </strong></h4>



<ul><li>0x v3</li><li>Bancor</li><li>Curve</li><li>Kyber</li><li>Oasis</li><li>Uniswap</li><li>Synthetix<br>&#8230;. and more</li></ul>



<p>With each new update, new tokens, exchanges, and integrations like Compound cTokens and CHAI are added to the X Blaster. We focus on token listings and improving your integrated X Blaster so you can focus on what matters.</p>



<h2>Custom fees enable flexible and sustainable business models</h2>



<p>We built DEX.AG because we understand the power of bringing the community together and the value that can create. We see our proxy contracts with custom fees as an opportunity for teams build sustainable models and grow their communities.</p>



<p>We know how crucial the right business model can be to finding the perfect product-market fit. You choose the custom fees on your X Blaster proxy contract. Developers know their users best and this gives them the flexibility to grow their community on their terms. </p>



<h2>X Blaster in action</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Imagine you&#8217;re trying out a new DeFi project. Everything is going smoothly; the instructions on screen guide you, making you feel confident in your actions. That is until you complete your transaction and then your tokens don&#8217;t arrive. You start to get that sinking feeling in your stomach as you realize you&#8217;ve received tokens the wrong tokens&#8230;</p>



<p>Looking at your transaction confirmation you realize you received a token with the same name and ticker symbol as the one you thought you selected. In fact, upon reviewing the token selection menu you realize there are lots of inaccurate and confusing tokens listed. It&#8217;s a simple mistake but costly mistake anyone could make that leaves a sour taste in your mouth about the whole experience.</p>



<h4>So what happened?</h4>



<p>On Ethereum, anyone can create a token with any name or ticker symbol. It&#8217;s not like registering a username on a website; there&#8217;s no native mechanism preventing a new token from having the same name, symbol, or even icon as an existing token. Whether intentionally or not, duplicate or misleading tokens are created all the time making mistakes like the one described above more and more likely to occur for even the most experienced users.</p>



<p>Not to mention, DeFi grows so quickly that it&#8217;s practically impossible to keep up with the countless new tokens being produced by projects. DAI alone has over 30 variations. This situation isn&#8217;t slowing down anytime soon and a lot of collective time is being spent in our community right now playing detective in order to determine if a token is the right token.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/token-list-thumb-1-wo-padding.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8247" width="638" height="638"/></a></figure></div>



<h2>Meet The Token List</h2>



<p>The Token List provides an accurate list of authentic tokens submitted and curated by the community. Its purpose is to create a standard list of tokens that everyone can rely on. <strong>Anyone can apply to have a token added to The Token List as long as it isn’t likely to be confused with previously listed or well-known tokens. And, it&#8217;s free for anyone to integrate The Token List into their project.</strong></p>



<p>A reliable well-vetted token list serves as a source of truth for the community helping ensure users are never confused by misleading tokens or outright scams. The idea is that when you see a platform is using The Token List, you can be confident that the tokens available are the real deal.</p>



<h3>Implementation is fast, easy and forever free</h3>



<p>Integrating The Token List into your project is simple and worry-free with little to no maintenance. <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a> lets your team work smarter, not harder. No more wasting man hours on listing new tokens on top of maintaining the ever-growing list of existing tokens. And best of all, <strong>it&#8217;s forever free to use</strong> &#8211; no upfront cost or ongoing fees.</p>



<p>The Token List provides all the relevant information for each authentic token in JSON format: </p>



<ul><li>token name</li><li>contract address </li><li>ticker symbol </li><li>decimals</li><li>icon image</li><li>token standard (ERC20, ERC223, etc)</li><li>and flags describing token qualities such as: is it used in governance, is it a social token, etc.</li></ul>



<p>We handle the listing and maintenance for you so you can get back to building what matters.</p>



<h4>Got a token? Apply to The Token List in a snap.</h4>



<p>As previously mentioned, anyone can submit an application to list any authentic token to The Token List. Simply, visit <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a>, click the &#8216;Add a Token now!&#8217; button (powered by Unlock Protocol). It costs a flat fee of 0.05 ETH to apply. And then, follow the prompts to fill out the simple form with the required token details. </p>



<p>We review all applications for authenticity and to ensure that they are unique enough to not confuse the average user. We want to help improve user experience, not act as gatekeepers, so we&#8217;ll err on the side of inclusion where possible (but for the safety of the community we do reserve the right to reject outright scams or tokens intending to mislead, etc).</p>



<h3>Adaptive token selection</h3>



<p>Opening up the token listing process benefits all involved by making UX/UIs become more responsive and inclusive. Instead of acting as a potential gatekeepers, DeFi projects now become advocates of collaboration and empower their community to take ownership of the token listing process. Additionally, the community lends their watchful eyes to help maintain the accuracy and authenticity of existing token listings (because we know how fast some things change in DeFi).</p>



<h3>Collaboration and composability</h3>



<p>The ability to connect and combine existing smart contracts to create something new is a defining aspect of DeFi. We&#8217;re an industry built on collaboration which increases the pace of innovation. Projects and users alike benefit from keeping this shared list of tokens up-to-date with the latest listings and changes to existing tokens, potentially serving as a catalyst for even more composability between DeFi projects. Naturally, it&#8217;s easier to work together when you&#8217;re all on the same page. For example: when one project submits their newest token, it&#8217;s automatically added to all projects using The Token List.</p>



<h2>Take advantage of The Token List today</h2>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re hacking together an idea, tired of maintaining your current token listings, or want to make your token known to the world, <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a> is a simple but effective solution to meet your needs.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re really excited for this release and the potential impact an open, accessible standard token list could have on DeFi. Standards can improve quality of life and safety for users and make developers&#8217; work easier and more efficient. We&#8217;re also interested to see how this list will grow with community input. We&#8217;re 100% open to new ideas like new descriptive flags. So please let us know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/defipulse">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/Gx4TCTk">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/defipulse">Telegram</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7922 size-full" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DFP-socialmoney-twitter-thumbnail01.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DFP-socialmoney-twitter-thumbnail01.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DFP-socialmoney-twitter-thumbnail01-300x150.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/01/DFP-socialmoney-twitter-thumbnail01-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Lately there&#8217;s been some buzz around the concept of social money in the crypto space. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the term, you&#8217;re probably asking yourself: &#8220;What is social money?&#8221; And to be honest, the term&#8217;s so loosely defined to the point it&#8217;s probably easier to see a few examples. So, here&#8217;s a <a href="https://exchange.tryroll.com/swap">Uniswap interface</a> and <a href="http://blockchain.buymagic.xyz/">curated list of examples</a> of social moneys in the wild for you to explore.</p>
<p>However, the basic concept goes as follows: someone mints tokens or coins redeemable for personal favors, rewards, and/or professional services. Most commonly, the minter then lists these personal tokens on Uniswap. Once purchased, the buyer can redeem their token for one hour of work such as consulting, developing, etc. Think of it as a way to sell your personal brand across platforms.</p>
<h4>Not all social moneys are equal</h4>
<p>As with most things in DeFi, social moneys come in many different shapes and sizes. Some critics have even compared them to personal ICOs, a novel way to bootstrap an idea that may not always pan out. For example, some social moneys mint upwards of 10M tokens. For those of you doing the mental math, 10M tokens worth 1 hour each adds up to over 1140 years worth of work. Some critics have been quick to point out that existing services like <a href="https://brave.com/brave-rewards/">Brave Rewards</a> or <a href="https://unlock-protocol.com/">Unlock Protocol</a> better suit the needs of some communities without the need for a separate token. All that being said, not all social moneys exist as work vouchers and there is merit in experimentation.</p>
<p><a href="https://tryroll.com/">Roll</a>, a social money platform, pitches social money as a way to cultivate a community. Issuers on Roll determine how their tokens can be earned and spent by community members. The utility and value of each social money is solely determined by how its issuer allows you to redeem it leaving a lot of room for interpretation. Maybe you want more interactions with your followers so you giveaway some tokens as a promotion. Or rather, maybe you want to offer exposure to your personal career. Ultimately, it&#8217;s up to the market to establish the true value of any social money and at what price it&#8217;s worth redeeming.</p>
<h4>Alternatives to social money</h4>
<p>Some might consider Spencer Dinwiddie&#8217;s <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/52682/nbas-spencer-dinwiddie-set-to-roll-out-tokenized-investment-platform-next-monday">recent tokenization of his NBA contract</a> to be a form of social money or at least the start of something that could evolve into social money. Granted, the major difference at this time is the fact that Dinwiddie&#8217;s contract and subsequent tokenization is backed by legal contracts. The terms of the contract are fixed and establish the value proposition of these tokens. This affords investors certain rights and legal protections which can be enforced in a court of law. The same can&#8217;t necessarily be said for many other social coins. So while the future of social money is unclear, the vision behind Mr. Dinwiddie&#8217;s tokenized contract might be a sign of what&#8217;s to come.</p>

<p>A coin burn is when you take cryptocurrency, coins, or tokens and destroy them. Many coins or tokens have built-in mechanisms which periodically burn a portion of their existing supply.</p>
<p>The idea is pretty simple. When you burn a coin, you lower the total supply of the coins in circulation. And according to the law of supply and demand, lowering the total supply of coins should theoretically increase its value as long as there is sufficient future demand for the coin.</p>
<h2><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7355 size-medium aligncenter" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/coinburn-300x300.png" alt="coin burn" width="300" height="300" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/coinburn-300x300.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/coinburn-150x150.png 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/coinburn-768x768.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/06/coinburn.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></h2>
<h2>A coin burn is similar to a stock buyback in traditional finance</h2>
<p>In traditional finance, companies will sometimes repurchase shares of their own stock. This is what&#8217;s called a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharerepurchase.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stock buyback</a>. The company can either buy the shares off the open market or pay shareholders a fixed price per share. Either way, you as a shareholder get to sell your shares at a profit and the company gets to increase its price-to-earnings ratio. Companies have increasingly turned to stock buybacks over issuing dividends for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>If a company wants to bolster the performance of their stock price, they can buy back their own shares from the open market to drive up the price. Investors see this growth and the company can sell back later when it needs cash flow.</p>
<h2>Coin burn in action</h2>
<p>Developers have similar motivations for burning their coins or tokens. However, developers have the advantage of being able to program supply-reducing burning functions right into their smart contract. Let&#8217;s dive into a few examples of smart contracts on the Ethereum network with built-in mechanisms to burn their tokens.</p>
<h3>Maker (MKR) tokens and the Dai Stablecoin System</h3>
<p><a href="https://makerdao.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maker</a> (MKR) is an ERC20 token that governs a smart contract credit system. Maker&#8217;s smart contracts allow you to borrow the stablecoin Dai against the value of your ETH. When you open a collateralized debt position (CDP) to borrow DAI, you are minting new DAI tokens.</p>
<p>To ensure DAI is always pegged at $1, you&#8217;re charged a yearly interest rate or stability fee. The MakerDAO, compromised of MKR holders, is in charge of controlling this fee and the peg of DAI to the US dollar. When the peg slips, MKR token holders vote to adjust the fees to increase or decrease demand for DAI accordingly.</p>
<p>When you go to repay the debt on your CDP, you&#8217;ll owe the outstanding debt in DAI and any interest fees accrued in MKR tokens. In the repayement process, you&#8217;re actually burning both the DAI and MKR tokens. Much like a stock buyback, burning MKR increases the value of remaining supply of tokens on the market as an incentive to own MKR tokens. As a MKR holders, you&#8217;re incentivized to make sure things are running smoothly much like the shareholders of a company.</p>
<h3>Kyber Network Crystal (KNC)</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://kyber.network/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kyber Network</a> is an on-chain liquidity protocol which allows users to swap tokens through its liquidity providers. Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) is an ERC20 token involved in nearly every aspect of this decentralized liquidity network.</p>
<p>KNC utilizes a burning mechanism to take a portion of its token supply out of circulation with every swap. Whenever you swap tokens on the Kyber Network, you pay your transaction fees in KNC. some of which is burned. Kyber recently <a href="https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-ecosystem-report-3-b2dc8ba0e44a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that in May they had crossed 1,000,000 KNC tokens burned.</p>
<p>Although that&#8217;s not all its used for, Kyber Network utilizes its token in a variety of ways to align the goals of each participant. From paying fees to open a liquidity reserve to receiving kickbacks for referrals as a vendor, the idea is to create utility and thus demand for KNC.</p>
