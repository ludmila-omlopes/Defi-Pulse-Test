<p><em><strong>TLDR: </strong><a href="https://docs.dex.ag/proxy-contract">Integrating DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster with custom fees</a> into your platform provides your users or smart contract with convenient native liquidity while allowing you to build a sustainable business model.</em></p>



<h2>Liquidity is vital for the growth of DeFi</h2>



<p>Users want to experience all DeFi has to offer. But often times to do that you  need to swap between tokens or stablecoins. Liquidity is an important resource that enables DeFi&#8217;s composability and makes it possible for many DApps to function. It&#8217;s the blood that flows through the veins of DeFi. </p>



<p>For a smooth user experience, it&#8217;s essential to have a reliable liquidity at a decent price. DEXes are an obvious choice for reliable liquidity when designing an application or smart contract. However, relying on a single DEX comes with its disadvantages. For example, maybe the token your users want to trade isn&#8217;t listed or has extremely low liquidity causing costly price slippage. </p>



<h3>DeFi is all about having options</h3>



<p>If one DEX isn&#8217;t ideal, The obvious answer is to do what DeFi does best with money legos and combine the awesome powers of DEXes. That&#8217;s why we built our other service DEX.AG, a DEX aggregator. DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster let&#8217;s you trade multiple DEXes and even splits trades across the combination of DEXes that results in the best price. Each DEX has its strengths, the X Blaster combines those strengths and connects users with the DEX or DEXes that best suits their needs. Not to mention, the X Blaster&#8217;s API has a blazing fast response time that delivers available trades within a fraction of a second so users never wait.</p>



<h4>X Blaster <strong>aggregates liquidity from popular DEXes: </strong></h4>



<ul><li>0x v3</li><li>Bancor</li><li>Curve</li><li>Kyber</li><li>Oasis</li><li>Uniswap</li><li>Synthetix<br>&#8230;. and more</li></ul>



<p>With each new update, new tokens, exchanges, and integrations like Compound cTokens and CHAI are added to the X Blaster. We focus on token listings and improving your integrated X Blaster so you can focus on what matters.</p>



<h2>Custom fees enable flexible and sustainable business models</h2>



<p>We built DEX.AG because we understand the power of bringing the community together and the value that can create. We see our proxy contracts with custom fees as an opportunity for teams build sustainable models and grow their communities.</p>



<p>We know how crucial the right business model can be to finding the perfect product-market fit. You choose the custom fees on your X Blaster proxy contract. Developers know their users best and this gives them the flexibility to grow their community on their terms. </p>



<h2>X Blaster in action</h2>

<p><strong><em>We spoke with Frontier Co-Founder &amp; Head of Marketing Palash Jain who longs to bring DeFi to the masses with slick features like</em></strong> <strong>TxLink.<em><br></em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I first heard about Ethereum back in 2017, and that&#8217;s where my crypto journey started. Entered into this space out of curiosity and ended up finding the fit in this space. Since then, I have worked with promising start-ups in the space, helping them on the Marketing and the growth end. Now Leading Marketing and Growth at Frontier to bring DeFi to masses.<br></p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>What are you building and what sets it apart? To briefly introduce, Frontier is a mobile-first, user-facing application. Frontier natively integrates multiple DeFi Protocols and wallets, making it super easy for users to Track, View and Manage positions across various DeFi protocols in real-time without having to give away private keys. </p>



<p>Frontier&#8217;s focus is bringing DeFi to Mobile, and that&#8217;s what sets us apart. We offer Native UI/UX for dApps and protocols and native wallet integration on Mobile. To bring wallet composability on mobile we came up with TxLink a middleware which enables Frontier to connect with multiple wallets such that user can choose the preferred wallet to sign transactions, thereby the user never gives away the private key nor has to import wallet. </p>



<p>If we look at the current way of interacting with dApps on Mobile, the experience is slow and sluggish on dApp browsers, and if there&#8217;s a product which offers native integration of dApps, perhaps the user has to create or import wallet onto that App. The user keeps hopping from one app to another app in search of perfect DeFi experience on Mobile. With Frontier, we remove this pain point by giving the user the options to choose existing wallets to transact with and better UI/UX experience.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>Our current users are sophisticated Defi users that are aiming for maximising their returns from their investments in this space. However, what brings Defi users to Frontier is the app simplicity and its user-friendliness, hence everyone&#8217;s invited to make the most of this space. </p>



<p>DeFi is for everyone and so is Frontier.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of exciting stuff which we are working on, our focus for the coming months is to integrate leading DeFi protocols such as MakerDao(Native Vaults module and DSR), Synthetix(Native Mintr), Compound, KAVA. Extend support to more wallets such as Gnosis Safe, Coinbase wallet. Gasless transactions for all DeFi operations via Frontier, and introduce Native staking for PoS and dPos based chains such as Matic Network.<br></p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>Frontier being a user-facing product, aims to bring DeFi to masses! Making it easy for users to access multiple financial protocols giving them the options to choose products based on their risk appetite. DeFi Bank which is open 24/7</p>



<h3>Whatâ€™s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of awesome stuff people are building in this space! Every single day is exciting in DeFi. Folks should look into Ren protocol &#8211; inter-blockchain liquidity for all dApps bringing BTC to Ethereum ecosystem and of course Frontier, every DeFi user must have this App <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f600.png" alt="ðŸ˜€" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p><strong><em>Alex Miles, co-founder of TokenTax, discusses his quest to ease the crypto community&#8217;s DeFi tax woes.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I first heard about bitcoin while i was in university around 2010, but didnâ€™t mine or purchase any (fml). I bought my first half bitcoin in 2013. Fast forward to 2017, I started trading and casually buying/selling alt coins, I realized that calculating taxes on my activity would be very complicated. </p>



<p>Over the course of a month in 2017, I built a simple demo application that linked your coinbase account and calculated your cost basis data. The application then generated a filled out 8949. I showed it to a few friends and they were really happy with the experience. I submitted what I built to the 2017 Product Hunt Global Hackathon and ended up winning the grand prize! </p>



<p>After that, I partnered with my co-founder Zac McClure who has a background in finance, accounting, and impact investing. Together we formed a plan to take TokenTax to the next level. A lot of our initial plan is now built and we plan to continue to grow the business.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>We are building the easiest way for cryptocurrency users to calculate and file their crypto taxes. At TokenTax we are intensely focused on building the best tax experience for DeFi. We believe DeFi has the potential to bring mainstream adoption to cryptocurrency and we want to do everything in our power to help make this a reality.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>Any cryptocurrency or DeFi user! We are an international crypto tax calculator so we support any country, not just the US.</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>Iâ€™m excited to continue to build out our DeFi tax tools. These are open to the public and can be used to download your transaction history for popular DeFi apps like Uniswap or compound. Every popular DeFi app in in the works like dYdX, Chai, and Maker to name a few <br>&#8211; <a href="https://tokentax.co/compound-finance">https://tokentax.co/compound-finance</a> <br>&#8211; <a href="https://tokentax.co/uniswap">https://tokentax.co/uniswap </a></p>



<p>We also have built a wonderful knowledge base of guides and help articles. We are working full time to build our more helpful resources:<br>&#8211; <a href="https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/">https://tokentax.co/guides/defi-crypto-tax/</a></p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>We plan on being the tax and reporting backbone behind DeFi. We want to help legitimize DeFi in the eyes of our government authorities around the world by providing users with excellent documentation.</p>



<h3>Whatâ€™s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>Honestly, I think one of the best things the DeFi community has, is the people within the community. Thereâ€™s so much creativity and passion being shared online and I think this helps fuel a ton of innovation. I think we often forget weâ€™re all on the same team. We should try to fight less about small topics that donâ€™t matter. We need to remember who we are fighting against.</p>



<h3>How can readers learn more about your product/service?</h3>
