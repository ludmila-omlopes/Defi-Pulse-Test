										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DAI is an ERC20 token designed to maintain a peg to the US Dollar, also known as a stablecoin, generated and maintained by the <a href="https://makerdao.com/">Maker Protocol</a>. Every single DAI in existence has been generated by users <a href="https://defipulse.com/maker">locking collateral into Maker&#8217;s smart contract system</a> and opening what&#8217;s called a Vault.</p>



<p>When you open a Maker Vault, you lock in collateral such as ether (ETH) or BAT. And then, you’re able to generate or borrow up to 2/3 of the US dollar value of your collateral in DAI. In other words, your Vault&#8217;s ratio of collateral value to total debt in DAI must be above 150%.</p>



<p>For every 1 DAI, there is at least $1.50 worth of collateral locked into a Maker Vault. And if your collateral value falls, you must lock in more ETH, pay back some of your debt, or risk having the collateral in your Vault liquidated. When a Vault position is liquidated, the held collateral is automatically sold to pay back the debts in addition to a penalty fee for failing to keep your collateral ratio above 150%.</p>



<h2>Using Maker&#8217;s Oasis portal to borrow your first DAI</h2>



<p><strong>Navigate to Maker&#8217;s <a href="https://oasis.app/borrow">Oasis Borrow</a>.</strong><br>There are many ways to interface with a Maker Vault; Oasis is <a href="https://github.com/OasisDEX">open-source</a> and was developed by the Maker. </p>



<p><strong>Connect the wallet of your choice and click &#8216;Get Started&#8217;</strong><br><a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> is a browser extension commonly recommended for interacting with many DApps. Ledger and Trezor are hardware wallets. Wallet Connect and Coinbase Wallet allow you to scan a QR code to access Oasis via mobile wallet.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="508" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019-1024x508.png" alt="" data-id="7995" data-full-url="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019.png" data-link="https://defipulse.com/blog/?attachment_id=7995" class="wp-image-7995" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019-1024x508.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019-300x149.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019-768x381.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019-1536x762.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019-1568x777.png 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999019.png 1918w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><strong>Select a collateral type and click &#8216;Continue&#8217;</strong><br>ETH and BAT are the only supported collateral types as of writing this. In this example, we selected ETH.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999017-1024x510.png" alt="" class="wp-image-7996"/></figure>



<p><strong>Setup Vault and Set Allowance</strong><br>Follow the prompts to send a few transactions in preparation for opening your Maker Vault and generating DAI. We recommend referencing <a href="http://ethgasstation.info/">EthGasStation</a> for the latest gas prices.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999016-1024x511.png" alt="" data-id="7997" data-full-url="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999016.png" data-link="https://defipulse.com/blog/?attachment_id=7997" class="wp-image-7997"/></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><strong>Deposit Collateral and Generate Dai</strong><br>Enter the amount of collateral you&#8217;d like to deposit and the amount of DAI you wish to generate. You cannot withdraw the collateral until you pay back any DAI you generate or borrow. Note, opening a Vault requires a minimum of 20 Dai to be generated. Click continue and confirm your transaction.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999018-1024x510.png" alt="" data-id="7998" data-full-url="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Selection_999018.png" data-link="https://defipulse.com/blog/?attachment_id=7998" class="wp-image-7998"/></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p><strong>Wait for your newly generated DAI to arrive in your wallet</strong><br>Once submitted, your transaction may take a moment depending on the gas price you paid. Finally, your transaction will be confirmed and your DAI should be available in your wallet.</p>



<h3>What can I use DAI for?</h3>



<p>DAI is one of the most liquid assets in the DeFi ecosystem. You can spend, save, lend, and tons more with your DAI. You can trade DAI for ETH, MKR, and many other ERC20 tokens at the best prices in DeFi using a DEX aggregator like <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a>.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">earn interest</a> by lending out your DAI on other DeFi lending protocols. Remember to keep in mind the stability fees you&#8217;ll owe on any DAI you generate or borrow from your Vault. And also, consider the various risks involved in lending some of which we cover in our <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/zero-to-defi-cdai/">Zero to DeFi</a> guide.</p>



<p>Another way to earn interest is to deposit DAI into Maker&#8217;s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dsr-dai-savings-rate/">Dai Savings Rate</a> (DSR). The DSR allows users to lock in DAI to earn a variable interest rate. However, don&#8217;t go generating DAI just to deposit it into the DSR because the DSR is designed to be lower than the stability fee. <a href="https://oasis.app/save">Learn more</a> about the Dai Savings Rate.</p>



<p>You&#8217;d be surprised the many interesting ways you can use your DAI! Explore <a href="https://github.com/makerdao/awesome-makerdao#dai-1">a full list of ecosystem resources</a> composed by the Maker community.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t panic. Everything is ok. The Maker system has been upgraded to Multi-Collateral Dai. You should see SAI in your wallet instead of DAI. This just means it&#8217;s time to migrate your &#8220;DAI&#8221;, now referred to as SAI, to Maker&#8217;s new architecture.</p>
<p>With the launch of Multi-Collateral Dai on November 18th, 2019, the name and ticker symbol of Single Collateral Dai is changing to Sai (SAI). DAI now refers to DAI minted in the new Multi-Collateral Dai system. The term Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) is also being replaced with the term &#8220;Vault&#8221; under MCDai.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-7776" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-1024x496.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="310" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-1024x496.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-300x145.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-768x372.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-1536x744.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology-1568x760.jpg 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/new-DAI-terminology.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></h3>
<p>These changes were made to reduce confusion during the transition period where both the Single Collateral and Multi-Collateral Maker systems will run in parallel. During this time, DAI and SAI will exist in the market together.</p>
<p>Each smart contract, platform, or service that previously used DAI is expected to change ticker symbols and upgrade accordingly. And while many services and exchanges plan to transition ASAP, the process isn&#8217;t going to be instant. Be careful not to confuse the two tokens and double-check before sending tokens anywhere. Mistakes may result in the loss of your funds.</p>
<h3>What changes are coming with Multi-Collateral Dai?</h3>
<p>As the name implies, Dai will now be backed by multiple assets instead of just Ethereum (ETH). At launch, the MCD system will support ETH and BAT tokens.</p>
<p>Additionally, the MakerDAO community will continue to assess and integrate new collateral types moving forward as part of the governance process. The following tokens are also being considered: Augur (REP), DigixDAO (DGD), Golem (GNT), OmiseGo (OMG), 0x (ZRX).</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dsr-dai-savings-rate/">Dai Savings Rate</a> (DSR) feature will give users the option to lock their DAI into Maker’s DAI Savings Rate contract and earn a variable interest rate in DAI.</p>
<p>One last small change is that the stability fee for borrowing DAI or &#8220;opening a Vault position&#8221; will now be owed in DAI instead of Maker (MKR).</p>
<h3>How do I migrate my SAI to DAI?</h3>
<p><strong>Be sure to only attempt to migrate Sai from a wallet where you control the private keys.</strong> If you do not control the keys to the wallet where your SAI is stored (like a centralized exchange or locked in a DApp), either withdraw your SAI to your own wallet or follow their instructions for how to migrate to DAI.</p>
<h4>To migrate your SAI to DAI:</h4>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://migrate.makerdao.com/">migrate.makerdao.com</a></li>
<li>Login with your wallet</li>
<li>Click &#8220;Continue&#8221; on the &#8220;Single Collateral Dai redeemer&#8221; tab</li>
<li>Enter the amount of SAI to upgrade</li>
<li>Submit your transaction</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>DONE! You should receive your Dai in your wallet momentarily.</p>
<h3>What should I do if&#8230;</h3>
<h4>I have a CDP open</h4>
<p>You have two options: migrate using Maker&#8217;s <a href="https://migrate.makerdao.com/">Migration App</a> or manually close your CDP. Using the Migration App requires you to pay back any stability fees owed in MKR at the time before migrating to a MCDai Vault.</p>
<h4>I use Compound Finance or hold cDAI</h4>
<p>Compound <a href="https://medium.com/compound-finance/support-for-multi-collateral-dai-c8691d0ef794">has stated</a> that existing SAI markets will continue to function as normal with no changes. &#8220;You are individually responsible for choosing when, and how, to migrate to Multi-Collateral DAI.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once ready, new DAI will be added to Compound and both markets will be accessible for the foreseeable future. Interest rates for both assets may be volatile during this time. cDAI users can withdraw their SAI and manually migrate to DAI at anytime.</p>
<p>Compound borrowers have the option to pay back their SAI debts and open new positions when DAI is ready. Alternatively, you can read on to learn how to migrate your Compound positions via InstaDApp</p>
<h4>I use InstaDApp</h4>
<p>InstaDApp is launching the <a href="https://medium.com/instadapp/mcd-migration-70782c9e6730">InstaDApp Migration Bridge</a> which allows Compound users to convert their SAI debt to DAI debt in one transaction. Although most users&#8217; debt positions are small enough, migration is subject to how SAI liquidity is available at the time.</p>
<h4>I use dYdX</h4>
<p>At launch, dYdX&#8217;s SAI markets will remain unchanged. dYdX <a href="https://medium.com/dydxderivatives/multi-collateral-dai-migration-on-dydx-e130575c4454">announced</a> that 2–3 weeks after DAI launches any remaining SAI balances, positions, and open orders will be converted to DAI automatically. Although, you can always close your positions, withdraw your SAI, and migrate manually at any time.</p>
<h4>I use Nuo Network</h4>
<p>Nuo <a href="https://medium.com/nuo-news/nuo-action-plan-for-multi-collateral-dai-a1aaa75142af">said that</a> it will rename DAI to SAI and all SAI loans, trades, and reserves will continue to exist. Nuo plans to provide a gas-free way to convert all positions by November 25th. Users may choose to either continue with existing SAI positions or convert them into DAI seamlessly on Nuo.</p>
<h4>I use Fulcrum or Torque Loans</h4>
<p>bZx Network&#8217;s <a href="https://medium.com/bzxnetwork/mcd-transition-plan-f2abd3176b09">transition plan</a> has you covered. Lenders on Fulcrum do not have to do anything immediately but can migrate via Fulcrum in a press of a button. SAI markets will continue to function normally and a new DAI lending pool will be launched. Torque borrowers will to continue to pay their SAI loans in SAI.</p>
<p>Fulcrum traders&#8217; SAI positions &#8220;will continue operating for as long as there is lending and exchange liquidity. If we see that the volume of the positions is coming close to exceeding what exchange liquidity for SAI can support, the positions will cease being perpetual and expire on their next rollover date.&#8221;</p>
<h3>How are exchanges handling the transition?</h3>
<p>Each exchange will handle the transition differently. We recommend you do your own research or simply withdraw your SAI and migrate it yourself. Here&#8217;s <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/single-collateral-dai-to-multi-collateral-dai-upgrade-timeline-and-actions/">a timeline</a> created by Maker documenting the upgrade and confirmed exchanges.</p>
<p>MCDai will be available to trade on Oasis Trade immediately upon its launch November 18th. Uniswap, Bamboo Relay, and Kyber Network will support both SAI and DAI trading as soon as possible.</p>
<p><a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> renamed DAI to &#8220;SAI old DAI (DAI)&#8221; in its menus. On Monday Nov. 18th, MCD DAI will be listed as DAI and ready to trade, sourcing liquidity from all available DEXes.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-and-coinbase-pro-plan-to-support-multi-collateral-dai-514407679b86">Coinbase and Coinbase Pro</a> plan to automatically convert any SAI you hold on Coinbase to multi-collateral DAI on December 2nd at 9 AM PST (you can get a <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/daley_e6">Coinbase account here</a> if you don&#8217;t have one).</p>
