										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) took over the world in 2021. While some people still can&#8217;t fully grasp their value proposition, they are an obsession for many others. Artists, collectors and investors have found fertile ground in the blockchain space, where they can trade and speculate on the price of intangible assets. And more importantly, do it seamlessly without auctioneers or any other middlemen. This is where <a href="https://defipulse.com/dodo">DODO</a>’s brand new feature allowing users to fractionalize NFTs called <a href="http://dodonft.io/">DODO NFT</a> comes in. With DODO NFTs, everyone is able to participate in the NFTs ecosystem by leveraging DODO’s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dodo-and-proactive-market-making/">Proactive Market Maker</a> (PMM) protocol.</p>



<h2>Why fractionalize NFTs?</h2>



<p>Although the NFTs ecosystem has seen enormous growth and success in the past months, creating a market for NFTs can still be difficult for many creators. Since NFTs are non-divisible by definition, their price discovery process is hard; ask and bid prices on NFTs usually have huge discrepancies and the most wanted items have prohibitive prices for the small investors and collectors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One way to overcome the hurdle of price discovery is with DODO’s approach to the concept of fractionalizing NFTs, which can give rise to a highly active and efficient secondary market. In DODO’s proposed mechanism, an NFT or a collection of NFTs are placed in a vault contract and then fragmented into sub-units by issuing ERC20 (fungible tokens) that represent the ownership of the vault. With this process, anyone can buy a fraction or share of an NFT, regardless of the amount of capital they can invest.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/jZP26I8hJDnvCEPmyR7hOnuwyZa5nKjXtEay_MFp4xIlp8zD45R-TvmDSEQr-pMCPaNCMyabEdaleujeIkk4yeY6mLGgSR2IqNLWmIIKV8wCmJDVeklpjd_cDgfzsAqPiwh3hF3H" alt="The fractionalization process using DODO"/><figcaption>The fractionalization process using DODO</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Owning an NFT collectively can be very appealing. The power of community ownership comes from an alignment of values and vision surpasses the amount of interest and money one individual can have. Fractionalizing an NFT collectible can also be powerful from a distribution point of view since, as more people own an NFT the more it signals the value of it to the community.<br></p>



<h2>Create flexible NFT markets with DODO’s PMM</h2>



<p>With DODO NFT, powered by DODO’s established Proactive Market Maker (PMM), creators can easily fractionalize NFTs and bootstrap a market with interconnected liquidity. DODO NFT’s complete suite of tools allows anyone to handle all the processes related to fragmentation, from the vault creation, the ERC20 tokens issuance, the contracts and the creation of dedicated DODO PMMs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO NFT represents a brand-new solution to pricing and liquidity formation of an NFT marketplace. To begin with, the vault contract can hold various assets, including one or more NFTs or a combination of selected ERC20 tokens, serving as an individual or an organization&#8217;s portfolio. Creators of DODO NFT Vaults can also choose to issue a predetermined amount of fungible tokens and select how many will be assigned to the team and how many will go directly to provide liquidity for the PMM.</p>



<h2>What is different from a traditional AMM pool?</h2>



<p>Suppose you issued a certain amount of tokens for an NFT community sale. Automated market makers that use a constant product approach, such as Uniswap V2, require initial liquidity to be deposited in order to set the initial price of the asset. If you want to create a liquidity market for all tokens, you will need to provide an equal amount of money as the bid-side liquidity to achieve the desired initial price.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO proactive markets allow you to provide single-sided liquidity. You can build a DODO NFT market and proactively set the starting price for a fragmented token without committing any capital. As traders buy the fungible tokens, the price will automatically increase following a curve. One other crucial contrast to automated market makers that use a constant product approach is that, in the former, only a single price curve is supported, while in the case of DODO PMM, it allows you to set a Slippage Coefficient (k) that gives the flexibility to handle different markets situations.<br><br>Below we can observe different price curves that can be set up with DODO PMM. The simplest one is when k=0. In this curve, the price doesn&#8217;t change with the amount sold. Any token will always be sold for the same price. In the opposite spectrum, k=1, the price increases with the amount sold in the same behavior as the constant product function. It&#8217;s possible to set more smooth curves choosing intermediary values for k. DODO PMM pools also allow for the customization of the trading fees collected from buyers rather than a fixed 0.3% fee.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Dodo-Curves-1024x446.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9228"/><figcaption>NFT PMM price curves with different “Slippage Coefficient” k.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Splitting up the DODO NFT Vault into fungible tokens can lead to a powerful mechanism as it allows composability to many other DeFi protocols. The underlying tokens can then be accessed using different DEXes and trading routes to be exchanged with any other token. They could even possibly be used as collateral for borrowing other assets like say for derivatives trading or even as a part of an NFT index primitive.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DODO is a decentralized exchange (DEX) platform powered by a unique Proactive Market Making (PMM) algorithm. <a href="https://dodoex.io/">DODO</a>’s PMM algorithm was developed entirely in-house by the DODO team iterating on the design of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) to improve capital efficiency, reduce impermanent loss, and minimize slippage for traders. Inspired by their previous work on DDEX, the DODO team set out to abstract the proactive market making concepts popular on order book-based exchanges into a permissionless on-chain liquidity protocol.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://dodoex.io/"><img src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/LOGO-DODO_τö╗µ¥┐-1-1024x375.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9050"/></a></figure>



<h3>DODO’s Proactive Market Making (PMM) algorithm in action</h3>



<p>To fully grasp what makes proactive market making different, take a step back and ask yourself: what is a market? A simple definition of a market is a place where you can exchange assets. A single trade doesn’t make a market; it is the constant distillation, distribution, and reaction to the data produced by buyers and sellers’ orders and trades that makes a market. Much of this data is typically represented by the ever-changing collection of orders being placed, removed, and executed from an exchange’s order books.</p>



<p>Traditional Automated Market Maker (AMM) DEXes automate the process of market making by pooling liquidity for two assets and replacing the order books with a simple fixed curve to determine the current price based on the current amount of each asset held. As the name implies, DODO’s Proactive Market Making algorithm is capable of proactively adjusting parameters such as asset ratio and curve slope in anticipation of market conditions, resulting in DODO pools that are adaptable and flexible for all sorts of use cases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DODO’s PMM pools can even be configured to utilize external price oracles to minimize impermanent loss and achieve higher capital efficiency. This configurability makes DODO’s PMM suitable for use cases varying from single-sided liquidity for bootstrapping pools to fully customizable market making strategies that adapt to market conditions in realtime.</p>



<p>Instead of breaking down the math, let’s explore the <a href="https://medium.com/dodoex/dodo-private-pool-professional-market-making-on-chain-b18a282596e3">DODO Private Pool (DPP)</a>, a feature aimed at professional market makers that best illustrates what makes DODO’s PMM algorithm special. If you’re interested in the formula behind DODO’s PMM, you can dig into the math <a href="https://dodoex.github.io/docs/docs/math">here</a>.</p>



<h3>DODO Private Pool (DPP) puts you, the market maker, in control</h3>



<p>DODO Private Pools put the full power of DODO’s PMM configurability at your fingertips empowering anyone to be a professional market maker. DPP allows market makers to do the following:</p>



<ol><li>Make one-sided deposits / withdrawals</li><li>Change the pricing curve at any time</li><li>Have liquidity everywhere in the price range from zero to infinity</li></ol>



<p>Imagine you want to be a market maker for ETH/USDC but you’re worried about ETH popping off and selling all your ETH to traders on the way up. With a DPP, you can perform a one-sided withdrawal to withdraw some of your ETH from the pool for safekeeping. This one-sided reduction of liquidity causes traders to go through the remaining ETH liquidity quickly driving up the price curve quicker than before. This sort of one-sided withdrawal can protect market makers against excessive risk. You can also do the opposite: withdraw USDC in anticipation of ETH’s price falling thus protecting you against the downside risk.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>Unlike a simple AMM, DODO Private Pools allow you as a market maker to customize your strategy, taking advantage of your human brain to actively influence a pool’s behavior. </p></blockquote>



<p>Say, for example, you feel the current market price of an asset doesn’t reflect its true value. In this scenario, you aren’t likely to provide liquidity for a simple AMM pool and may even remove liquidity for that asset to avoid impermanent loss. This is because you cannot directly influence the price at which the pool is selling the asset. DODO Private Pools provide a better way with a process called ‘active price discovery’ which allows you to adjust the market price inside the DPP directly. Ultimately, market makers’ ability to actively influence the price discovery process allows them to utilize their knowledge, experience, and intuition to craft a more efficient market.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default"><p>DODO Private Pools can even allow you to create specialized markets like constant price markets for low slippage stable asset swaps. </p><p>This is achieved by market makers setting a DPP’s k value to a very small non-zero value (e.g. k = 0.001) to get an “approximately constant” pricing curve not dissimilar to stablecoin swaps on Curve Finance.</p></blockquote>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>While DODO’s PMM and Private Pools sure are interesting, this dodo isn’t nearly finished evolving. DODO has lots more features and upgrades planned for this year. We’ll be covering more DODO features in the future.
