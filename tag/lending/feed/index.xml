										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Users from around the world should be able to easily access the benefits of decentralized finance. Yet in DeFi’s early days, you could really only be initiated to these benefits by manually figuring things out on your own through trial and error. This has kept accessibility at bay in kind!&nbsp;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s needed, then, is an advanced DeFi transaction builder made simple &#8211; a system where anyone can readily manage a range of different activities, from yield farming to leveraged positions and debt refinancing, from a single dashboard and regardless of skill level. Stepping up to the plate here is DeFi management solution <a href="https://bit.ly/34TuwmX"><strong>DeFi Saver</strong></a>, which just launched the beginnings of such a system via its new powerful <em>Recipe Creator</em> feature. </p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><a href="https://bit.ly/34TuwmX"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KN58a0-eduwIKya0Q6ED80owTuiUvM12iaewWfFkfE_2N0R7JGb-bMNvryr5349sctQAiwoI8SWHrdnTLW1Y2Tt46pMtfiedWHj6fAu7fNXoDbfMd7m1OTCz33Qlgg6J-ZeiZw_I" alt=""/></a></figure></div>



<h2><strong>Cooking up all things DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>The <strong>Recipe Creator</strong> is a transaction builder interface for creating and executing <em>recipes</em>. Simply put, recipes are blends of DeFi activities that can involve interactions between multiple DeFi apps and additionally utilize flashloans and token swaps.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <strong>flashloan</strong> lets users borrow large amounts of crypto <em>without collateral</em> so long as the debt is paid back within the same transaction but, previously, flashloans were mostly isolated to the domain of DeFi experts. That’s all changing now that <strong>the Recipe Creator is letting anyone easily use these powerful tools</strong> to streamline multiple DeFi actions into single transactions, all through DeFi Saver’s audited, reputable, and user-friendly infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><a href="https://bit.ly/3vZU0el"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--jdU88PMEzy-iT1u8Sc0mHiW21LsZ_nrQlYzEDltwQqiouuIFmq116rjbRJV8grBBzmQBz3FHzAD2TVZnvVG8bK9bVLg2oxsxo1hJSG2fDiTtrN7xd3hvQgCVxCEGUxugjeUYJY" alt=""/></a></figure>



<p>The Recipe Creator itself is currently divided into two main parts: the <a href="https://bit.ly/3vZU0el">Recipe Book</a>, which is composed of pre-made recipes or rather pre-structured DeFi strategies, and the eponymous <a href="https://bit.ly/3g1pL1j">Recipe Creator</a>, which allows builders to <strong>simply drag-and-drop their own recipes together</strong> however they please. </p>



<p>Additionally, the Recipe Creator makes use of natural language processing, so users can just write simple instructions like “Supply 500 DAI to Compound” or sequences of instructions separated by commas to quickly create recipes. Recipes currently support actions across top DeFi apps like <strong>Aave, Compound, Maker, Reflexer, and Uniswap V2</strong>, and the DeFi Saver team plans to integrate new protocols regularly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ease of these future integrations will come courtesy of DeFi Saver’s recently overhauled smart contract system, which now composes transactions efficiently as mixtures of composable activities rather than one long string of stacked actions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The result is an <strong>optimized transaction builder</strong> system that lets users conveniently manage a range of staple DeFi activities, like borrowing, lending, creating and managing leveraged positions, and yield farming. And if you&#8217;re creating a collateralized debt position in order to obtain stablecoins or other assets for liquidity farming purposes, note that DeFi Saver also has liquidation protection options in the form of their Automation features.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Simulate recipes before you try them</strong></h2>



<p>DeFi Saver notably released a new <strong>Simulation mode</strong> feature alongside the Recipe Creator. This mode lets you quickly spin up a simulated 100 ETH account and then experiment with executing recipes and more with this simulated ETH in any way you see fit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accordingly, gone are the days where users must use <em>actual ETH</em> on the Ethereum mainnet to first get the hang of DeFi activities. Instead, when activated <strong>Simulation mode forks at the current Ethereum block</strong> so you can freely play around with market conditions, e.g. prices, as they existed upon activation. This gas-less environment is perfect for helping novices and veterans alike practice and strategize their DeFi activities.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/3vARUuaRvmMdANfwH6iyHoXHxSubL1O_oUOJ6Ig4e5Zc6jHnlyyscW1HY820cEiFWI9vnDSLZwtnNaWk5QUVE5uozCYsRT-X55AYcTi__KCFcrkyHg86im1GkPscSi6lZBR0jf5p" alt=""/></figure></div>



<p>If you’re interested in starting a Simulation account on DeFi Saver and taking some recipes for a spin, simply <strong>click on the “Simulation” button on the lower left-hand corner of the DeFi Saver dashboard</strong>. Upon doing so, select whether you want to create a new simulated account with 100 play ETH or to simulate your current account as it exists at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Don’t sleep on the Recipe Creator</strong></h2>



<p>As it currently stands, the Recipe Creator already has the potential to bring in more than a few new DeFi users by making the UX around using DeFi so streamlined and convenient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the DeFi Saver team wants to improve this UX even further with more additions and advancements. For starters, new integrations with DApps like Lido, Liquity, and Yearn are on the slate for the near future as are integrations with promising layer-two (L2) scaling solutions like Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync 2.0. The DeFi Saver team is also exploring the automation of recipes, so consider keeping an eye out for that as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are interested in tracking the progress of the Recipe Creator going forward, you can stay up to date on all current happenings by following DeFi Saver on <a href="https://bit.ly/34VQnKF">Twitter</a> or by joining the project’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/XGDJHhZ">Discord</a> community. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Previously, providing liquidity to automated market maker (AMM) projects in DeFi has been a manual and somewhat tedious process. You source the required amount of tokens for your desired pair, approve token contracts, pay gas fees to deposit, and then if you’re looking to farm further yields you might go and stake your new liquidity provider (LP) tokens, which takes yet another transaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>You go through all these steps only to endure the risk of impermanent loss (IL) while you serve as an LP. Now, though, <em>it is</em> possible to provide liquidity and earn DeFi yields simply and without the risk of IL. That’s because <a href="https://impermax.finance/"><strong>Impermax</strong></a>, a decentralized marketplace for borrowing and lending LP tokens, is offering a game-changing new way to participate in LPing called <em>Indirect Liquidity Providing</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uqVZj40ev81y7CVPscU_0BVsVbfsJJdOBw4VjUjsn0FlIU629FU_0Xnxwji7vd5dEYl2qaZZDIR_l1n-QHD0xv5zWwFbETl4airftBWwWfbQF-iVk3VMoZFQHmnrTNA_r6ThM_Ui" alt=""/></figure>



<h2><strong>A new way to LP in DeFi</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Indirect Liquidity Providing</strong>, a novel way to participate in DeFi liquidity markets, involves earning yield by <em>lending </em>assets to other LP token holders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the <a href="http://defipulse.com/impermax">Impermax</a> system this works through the protocol’s lending pools, which use LP tokens like ETH-DAI Uniswap V2 LP tokens as collateral. These pools only allow borrowing and lending around a given pool’s token pair, such as ETH and/or DAI if you’re borrowing against ETH-DAI UNI-V2 tokens.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Accordingly, DeFi users can now supply a <em>single </em>token to an Impermax lending pool to earn yields indirectly through an AMM, all while facing essentially no threat of impermanent loss. This is in stark contrast to the IL risk users take on when they directly serve as LPs!&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://impermax.finance/"><img loading="lazy" width="555" height="329" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/2z3yCV7xfTT6sA_rTwCtmQN47qNPcMAicueZTYMiZ9_DZP4SQEghbdR73-3fxZvHPL7D7fsnXJdHC6-v0Kx8kU2EKtvRsAkit5QQp6aO0JtDS4YkjtZBE23z9RhMDhPy2KOzLGHc"></a></p>



<p>In this way, we can understand Impermax as an <strong>Indirect Liquidity market</strong>. Users lend their assets to yield farmers, who then convert these assets into further LP tokens in order to boost their own yields. These yield farmers take on all the risk of impermanent loss while paying out a portion of their yields to pay back their loans from Impermax lenders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Yield farming made simple</strong></h2>



<p>A key advantage of the Indirect Liquidity Providing system is that it offers lenders an easy, simplistic avenue for yield farming. This is because Impermax’s lending markets do away with having to go through multiple steps like acquiring LP tokens and thereafter staking them in order to farm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, <strong>lending through Impermax offers a casual, one-step, staking-like process for yield farming</strong>: you deposit a token into your lending pool of choice, and voila, you’re earning yield and can claim it any time. That’s about as simple as it gets when it comes to farming opportunities in DeFi, so these farms also minimize the need for transactions, which can really add up gas-wise with other traditional yield farms!&nbsp;</p>



<p>DeFi beginners want entry-level yield farms, and DeFi veterans enjoy simple passive earning opportunities, so Indirect Liquidity Providing has a little something for everyone. This will ensure Impermax will continue to have an important role to play in DeFi, as there’s big demand for simple yield farming solutions while many AMMs are becoming increasingly complex, like Uniswap V3.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Good for DeFi</strong></h2>



<p>To compete with traditional finance, DeFi will need to continue being a liquidity blackhole and continue attracting in more money. More money equals more efficiency, and more efficiency means better options for users.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As such, <strong>Impermax’s Indirect Liquidity Providing innovation represents a benefit for all of DeFi</strong>, insofar as this new lending style makes it easier to provide liquidity to AMMs and can thus help these AMMs grow faster than they would have otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In time, then, we might even see some AMM projects incentivize and promote Impermax’s lending markets since these markets can serve as a direct and increasingly important pipeline of activity to them.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Learn more about Impermax</strong></h2>



<p>Impermax is a first-of-its-kind protocol for borrowing and lending LP tokens, so be sure to keep the project on your radar as it now works on adding support for LP tokens from Uniswap V3 and other major DeFi trading protocols like Curve and SushiSwap. You can learn more by following Impermax on <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpermaxFinance">Twitter</a> or by joining in on the project’s community discussions on <a href="https://discord.gg/XN739EgG4X">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ImpermaxFinance">Telegram</a>.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Chaz Schmidt:</strong> <em>Hello and welcome @everyone ! Thank you for joining us today for an AMA with Simone Rigolon, Founder of Impermax.</em></p>



<p><em>Simone will be answering questions we&#8217;ve collected from you, the community, throughout the week. Special thanks to everyone who submitted questions for today&#8217;s AMA.</em></p>



<p><em>Thanks for joining us Simone.</em> <strong>How are you today?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone Rigolon</strong>: Hi Chaz and DeFi Pulse community! It&#8217;s a pleasure to be here.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m very good, and you?</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I&#8217;m doing quite well. Thanks for asking.<br><br>To start things off, can you share a little about Impermax for the audience? </em><strong>What is Impermax?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Impermax is a decentralized lending protocol designed around LP tokens.</p>



<p>It allows borrowers to use LP tokens as collateral to take loans. This enables them to enter in leveraged positions on their LP tokens.</p>



<p>On the other hand lenders are able to &#8220;indirectly provide liquidity&#8221; to Automated Market Makers by supplying their tokens to the borrowers. Lenders are able indirectly earn from AMMs trading fees without any exposure to impermanent loss.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Very cool. You touched on a point that piqued the community&#8217;s interest earlier this week on Twitter. </em><strong>Can you explain lndirect Liquidity Providing for those unfamiliar with the concept?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone:<em> </em></strong>Let&#8217;s start from normal liquidity providing which means supplying tokens to an AMM. This can be a very profitable way to invest capital, but at the same time there is the risk of impermanent loss and there are some complexity that are going to get worse with time. Basicallly it is not ideal for the average user.</p>



<p>Indirect liquidity providing means that you can lend your tokens to liquidity providers. They will borrow them and use them to provide liquidity to AMMs and earn trading fees. In return you will get a percentage of the trading fees they earn. This is ideal for the average user because it can be a &#8220;set and forget thing&#8221;, there is no exposure to IL and it requires only a single token.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong><em> Ahh. So for example with for the USDC/ETH LP token pool you could provide USDC and earn trading fees without exposure to impermanent loss?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Exactly <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>Browsing through Impermax ahead of the AMA I noticed that LP token lending pools are isolated. </em><strong>What does this mean for Impermax users and what led to the decision to isolate the lending pools?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>There are many reasons that lead to this decision but the main one is that we wanted to build a protocol that was as permissionless as possible. Keeping all lending pools separated means that anyone can create a new one because even a malicious pool wouldn&#8217;t be able to affect negatively all the other existing pools.</p>



<p>The main advantages of this choice are scalability, security and minimized governance.</p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong> <em>That makes sense. Isolating the pools also isolates risk, mitigating any chance of systematic failure from one bad pair.</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Exactly, it&#8217;s an architecture very similar to the one used by Uniswap for pairs.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>So Uniswap pairs are supported by Impermax today and the community wants to know: </em><strong>What AMM LP tokens do you plan to support in the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>The plan is to add support for more AMMs like Uniswap V3, SushiSwap, PancekeSwap and others. Ideally we would want to support as many LP tokens as possible. Luckily our choice of keeping all lending pairs isolated allow us to scale as much as we want since supporting a new LP tokens doesn&#8217;t have any drawback on the existing ones.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I&#8217;m glad you brought up Uniswap V3 because I saw that on your <a href="https://impermax.medium.com/impermax-road-map-e320fdb4652d">roadmap</a> the other day and wondered how that will work with V3&#8217;s new price curve NFT setup. </em><strong>Can you shed any light on that at this time? </strong><em>We will accept soon <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> if necessary</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> I can&#8217;t give too many details on how exactly it will work because we&#8217;re still researching LP NFTs and the way they can be used as collateral. Some complicated math involved, so it&#8217;s hard to talk about that in an AMA. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f605.png" alt="😅" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>Personally I&#8217;m very excited about supporting LP NFTs on Impermax because Uniswap V3 is very capital efficient by itself, and with NFTs enabled to be used as collateral that&#8217;s going to improve even more!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>No worries! The audience can stay tuned for that one. We only have a few minutes left anyways.</em></p>



<p><em>Since we&#8217;re on the topic of the roadmap,</em> <strong>what’s coming up on the roadmap that you’re excited about?</strong><br><br><em>Or even a recent release since you mentioned LP NFTs.</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone:</strong> Many things like new features for the existing app, support for Uniswap V3 support for layer 2 and other networks.</p>



<p>I bet users are going to be very happy once Impermax releases on lower fees networks, but personally the thing I&#8217;m most excited about is Uniswap V3 support, for the reasons I&#8217;ve just talked about. Capital efficiency is key for AMMs in the long term and both UniswapV3 and Impermax are solutions to improve it.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>When you put it like that, it&#8217;s easier to see why on your website, you describe Impermax as “The missing piece to the Automated Market Makers&#8217; puzzle”</em></p>



<p><em>In your own words, </em><strong>how does Impermax complement AMMs and where do you see Impermax fitting into the puzzle?</strong><br><br><em>We&#8217;ve reached 30 minutes. Do you have time to answer this and maybe one other question?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Wow time runs fast. Yes, I have have time.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I know right? Awesome I wanted to touch on one other aspect of Impermax that our community was asking about.<br><br>Impermax introduced a liquidity mining program which rewards users with IMX tokens for borrowing on Impermax.</em> <strong>What was the motivation behind incentivizing borrowing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong> The main reason is to incentivize the protocol usage and attract more liquidity. Impermax needs a lot of liquidity in order for the incentives to really work as they should. Farming is always a good way to bootstrap a new protocol.</p>



<p>There are a few reasons why we incentivized only borrowing and not lending. The main one is because lenders are still indirectly rewarded since the borrowing demand is very high. Not giving the reward to lenders means that they don&#8217;t have to worry about claiming it and instead they are rewarded with an higher supply APR that will compound over time.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Interesting. In other words, borrowers pursuing more liquidity mining rewards earn more trading fees for lenders.<br><br>I think that&#8217;s about all the time we have for today. Is there anything else you&#8217;d like to say?</em></p>



<p><strong>Simone: </strong>Not really, I just want to thank you and DeFi Pulse for organizing this event. It was a pleasure to answer these questions.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>You&#8217;re welcome as always. Thank you for coming! I learned a thing or two and I&#8217;m sure the audience found it helpful.</em></p>



<p><em>And thank you all for coming to today&#8217;s AMA!</em></p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size"><em>The Founder Fireside Chat series hosted by DeFi Pulse interviews DeFi founders in the hopes of offering readers an opportunity to better understand their perspective and what drives them to build their vision.</em></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Welcome! We&#8217;re glad to have you back for another Founder Fireside Chat. This week, we sat down with Robert Lauko, Founder and CEO of <a href="https://defipulse.com/liquity">Liquity</a>, whose work aims to push the bounds of decentralization.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9026" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q1-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In contrast to other stablecoins and CDP platforms, Liquity is optimized for making borrowing as attractive as possible. It achieves this by replacing interest rates with a very low, one-time fee (most of the time only 0.5%) paid upfront on the borrowed amount and by only requiring a collateral ratio of 110%. This makes borrowing LUSD very capital efficient, cheap for medium to long term loans, and particularly interesting for leverage seekers. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Liquity also has a unique approach to handling liquidations. In other systems, under-collateralized positions are usually resolved through lengthy collateral auctions. Liquity replaces these auctions by pooling together capital (i.e. LUSD) upfront from users wishing to buy liquidated collateral effectively at a ~10% discount. We call this mechanism the Stability Pool. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Lastly, as a result of its radical approach to immutability, Liquity is also completely algorithmic, with the system being able to auto-adjust to external circumstances like a peg break.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9030" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q2-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In a strict sense, <strong>security is the most important since an unsecure system is flawed even if it’s scalable or decentralized, while centralized and unscalable systems can have legitimate use cases. </strong></p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">For building a highly dynamic application like Liquity with its redistribution mechanism, we had to go miles to work around Ethereum’s scalability issues. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">On the other hand, we are pushing the concept of decentralization by not running an official frontend and by making the protocol fully immutable. But without being secure, these features would mean nothing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9134" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Q6-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">In order to form a lasting community that sticks with your product or service, you need to make sure that you can offer sustainable value in the long run rather than just temporary benefits. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>While yield farming opportunities are great to attract early adopters, it is crucial to keep delivering long term utility regardless of the market conditions. </strong>Furthermore, you need to make sure that your users and community members have easy access to the team and that their questions, concerns, and ideas are heard.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9031" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q3-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Most of the focus has been on decentralizing the backend, i.e. the smart contracts, while few projects have tried to decentralize their frontends too.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"> IPFS and Arweave are interesting in this regard, but they are detached from the platform (e.g. Ethereum) that is hosting the backend. With DFINITY’s Internet Computer, it will become possible to seamlessly decentralize the backend and the frontend using the same technology stack. With their recent launch, they’ll be worth keeping an eye on.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9032" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q4-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Over the last 1.5 years it became clear to me how important it is to build a team that is motivated, shares the same principles, and is aligned with the vision of the project. </p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>When people are committed to a common goal and working together as a group, they can create incredible results. </strong>Outsourcing tasks to third parties and companies turned out to be much more challenging and less successful in my experience.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9033" width="1200" height="220" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5.png 1200w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-300x55.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-1024x188.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Q5-768x141.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Being a liquidity provider in DeFi has typically been associated with opportunity costs and risks, particularly the always dreaded risk of impermanent loss. As a liquidity provider, it is important to familiarize yourself with the concept of impermanent loss and determining when the risk to reward ratio is right. But the truth is you have options aside from accepting impermanent loss as an inevitability, you could explore what’s possible with <a href="https://impermax.finance/">Impermax</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Impermax set out to build what they refer to as the “missing piece of the AMM puzzle,” a protocol which allows users to maximize their AMM liquidity pool (LP) tokens. With Impermax, anyone can create a lending market for Uniswap (and soon to be other) AMM LP pairs. Liquidity providers can utilize their LP tokens as collateral to borrow tokens or leverage/multiply their AMM LP positions. Impermax allows users to put LP tokens to work which were once idle leading to more complex strategies and potentially ecosystem growth spurred by increased productivity.</p>



<h2>Maximize the productivity of your AMM LP tokens</h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><a href="https://impermax.finance/"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/impermax-blog-thumb-300x300.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9190" width="300" height="300"/></a></figure></div>



<p>As previously mentioned, Impermax is <a href="https://impermax.finance/a-lending-market-designed-for-the-lp-tokens-of-uniswap-and-other-amms/">a lending market designed for liquidity pool tokens</a> of Uniswap and other AMMs. Let’s examine how this works behind the scenes. As a borrower, you must first deposit your LP tokens to use as collateral before being able to borrow or leverage. Impermax takes the LP tokens provided as collateral and allows users to borrow the underlying tokens in the LP pair. Interestingly, lenders can choose to lend one or both of the tokens in a LP pair to earn interest without any exposure to impermanent loss. Impermax refers to this as lndirect Liquidity Providing because lenders are basically earning a percentage of the trading fees that borrowers earn but without any impermanent loss.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that lending pools are isolated to each LP token pair and loans are 100% backed by the tokens inside the LP token pair held as collateral. The Time-Weighted Average Price or TWAP provided by Uniswap is used to calculate the liquidation prices of loans to ensure loans remain 100% collateralized. This is kind of cool because it enables Impermax users to permissionlessly add new Uniswap LP tokens and start a lending market for any LP token pair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Borrowers can choose to borrow either token in the pair individually for a unique strategy or simply borrow both to obtain leverage for their desired LP position. Impermax provides an easy to use interface which simplifies the process of leveraging LP tokens up to 10x to a single transaction. Impermax has a liquidity mining program which rewards users with <a href="https://impermax.medium.com/impermax-tokenomics-34cb3dd66474">IMX tokens</a> for borrowing select token pairs. Since your rewards are based off of borrowing, you can actually multiply your liquidity mining rewards by leveraging select token pairs.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/04/borrowable-collateral-infographic.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9191" width="340" height="312"/></figure></div>



<h2>Use caution when operating power tools</h2>



<p>As with all things in DeFi, nothing is without risk. We’ll be discussing some here but as always we encourage you to do your own research. Luckily, Impermax has a very nice <a href="https://app.impermax.finance/risks">risks section </a>to aid you in your due diligence. Like most lending markets in DeFi, it’s possible that you may temporarily be unable to withdraw tokens as a lender if the lending pool has insufficient liquidity like in the event of a “bank run.” Although it should be noted that the dynamic interest rates are designed to alleviate these issues eventually. And of course, if you borrow or leverage, you face the potential risk of liquidation if you don’t meet collateral requirements.</p>



<p>You should also be aware that the permissionless nature of Impermax lending pools is a double-edged sword that carries unique risks. Since anyone can add a new AMM LP token pair and create a lending market, anyone can add new pairs even if they have low liquidity or are potentially malicious. Luckily, these risks are isolated to individual AMM LP token pairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Remember, Impermax relies on Time Weighted Average Prices from the AMM. This means that if a pair is inactive for a long period of time, the price of the oracle may differ substantially from the market price. Additionally, an inactive pair may not attract enough liquidators to insure loans are liquidated in time which can result in a possible loss for lenders.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>You can never quite tell which direction the DeFi community will run with an idea but the writing is on the wall that liquidity providers want more out of their LP tokens. Impermax has designed their product to cater to the needs of these liquidity providers in a permissionless way similar to the AMMs themselves. This is enabled by Impermax’s practical and prudent decision to isolate risk to individual lending pools. Builders don’t have to ask for permission to whitelist their project’s AMM LP pair and can even permissionlessly incorporate Impermax lending pools at a protocol level.</p>



<p>Whether you’re a borrower looking to leverage your LP tokens or a lender looking to earn some extra yield from indirect liquidity proving, you should explore <a href="https://impermax.finance/">Impermax</a> available lending pools today. If you’re unsure or just want to take a test drive, you can test Impermax’s application at no cost on Ropsten testnet with zero risks. Don’t forget to follow Impermax on <a href="https://twitter.com/ImpermaxFinance">Twitter</a> or join the community (<a href="https://discord.gg/XN739EgG4X">Discord</a> and <a href="https://t.me/ImpermaxFinance">Telegram</a>) to stay informed on the latest updates.</p>



<p><em>Disclosure: This post is part of our paid promotional DeFi Pulse Partner Program; We’ve partnered with Impermax to help educate and inform the community about its permissionless lending markets.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The average person would describe cryptocurrency as highly volatile. And while this is true for many, there are coins designed to reduce volatility or stability commonly referred to as stablecoins. Stablecoins, particularly those pegged to the US Dollar, have dramatically risen in popularity thanks to the utility they provide to users and smart contracts alike. Users tend to gravitate to the narrative of USD pegged stablecoins as a familiar unit of account. However, history has shown that stablecoins pegged to the value of a specific asset or basket of assets don’t always hold their peg. And when they do go off peg, it can quickly diminish the reputation of a stablecoin built on the premise of always being $1.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Limiting a stablecoin to always equaling $1 also limits the mechanisms available to a community to bring the stablecoin back on peg. This can lead to added complexity like introducing new collateral types and subsequently undesired risk in lieu of what many would argue is the simpler mechanism: negative interest rates. In the end, many stablecoins resort to centralized custodians to hold USD in a bank somewhere or governance systems that require lots of participation to maintain relative stability.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reflexer’s RAI returns crypto to its roots drawing inspiration from the early days of stablecoins to offer crypto-native stability. RAI is an ETH backed, non pegged stable asset known as a reflex index whose monetary policy is managed by an on-chain, autonomous controller. <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5626157429&amp;iu=/22134506417">Reflexer</a> launched on mainnet on Feb 17, 2021.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5626157429&amp;iu=/22134506417"><img loading="lazy" width="1000" height="562" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reflexer_banner_youtube2__1_.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8909" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reflexer_banner_youtube2__1_.png 1000w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reflexer_banner_youtube2__1_-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/reflexer_banner_youtube2__1_-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></a></figure>



<h3>RAI allows you to trustlessly leverage your ETH</h3>



<p>For reasons we’ll cover in the next section, the function of RAI may be familiar to those with an understanding of MakerDAO’s DAI. DeFi users can borrow RAI via Reflexer by depositing ETH as collateral into what’s called a Safe. Borrowed RAI is subject to an interest rate referred to as the borrow rate. Safes must maintain a minimum collateral ratio of 145%. If a Safe position fails to maintain this collateral ratio, the Safe will incur a liquidation penalty and the protocol will sell collateral to keepers at a discounted rate to cover the debt. Note: there’s also a minimum amount of RAI that must be generated by a Safe. This ensures that in the event of liquidation the Safe has enough collateral to cover its debt and the necessary gas costs and incentives for keepers necessary to liquidate the position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>RAI boils down to this: a volatility-reduced representation of ETH. It’s designed to float similar to other currencies and not be pegged to anything. Reflexer relies on a set of protocol parameters including borrowing power and market price to determine the price RAI can be redeemed for (more on this in a bit). RAI was launched with a starting redemption price of $3.14. From this point on, RAI will continue to float while it is managed by the protocol’s on-chain controller. Actually, there’s a chance it never returns to its original redemption price at all. Market forces and Reflexer protocol user incentives influence where the redemption price of RAI floats to. At the time of writing, there are 766 active safes and 24,755,216 RAI in total. You can view the current market price, redemption price, and borrow rate along with other RAI stats <a href="https://stats.reflexer.finance/">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Inspired by the original Dai Purple Paper</h2>



<p>Some of you may recall that the original concept of the DAI stablecoin system outlined in the “Dai Purple Paper” back in February 2018 included negative interest rates. In fact, DAI wasn’t always meant to equal $1 at all. DAI was meant to have a redemption price that would float, producing low volatility but driven by the market.</p>



<p>Reflexer’s RAI aims to fill this void by borrowing many of the concepts from the Dai Purple Paper. Reflex indexes like RAI are designed to reduce volatility, shielding users against major and sudden moves in the market like the<a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/defi-status-report-black-thursday/"> events witnessed on Black Thursday</a>. On a technical level, <a href="https://docs.reflexer.finance/">the system behind RAI</a> is a modified fork of multi-collateral DAI with a few distinct changes. Some of these changes include autonomous feedback mechanisms that control user incentives, simplified variable names, more flexible collateral auctions, long term bounded&nbsp; governance, optional Safe insurance and more. While DAI may have strayed from its early vision leaving its hypothesis untested, Reflexer’s mainnet demo Proto RAI illustrated how an asset can create stability without a peg, relying solely on market forces and redemption price float.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Proto RAI (PRAI) demo ran for nearly 3 months before being shut down on January 25, 2021. More than $612K worth of ETH was deposited into the demo to mint almost 52K PRAI; PRAI’s redemption price started at $2.015 and then floated between $1.937 and $2.06. During this same time period, ETH increased by 350% going from about $400 to $1400. Doing the math, this means PRAI’s redemption price fluctuated less than 4%, demonstrating how Reflexer’s reflex indexes can be a more stable representation of its collateral.</p>



<h2>How exactly do reflex indexes create stability without pegs?</h2>



<p>The money god wills it so. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f5ff.png" alt="🗿" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Or at least that’s the meme the Reflexer community has adopted to refer to the set of on-chain, autonomous controllers that control RAI’s monetary policy. At this point, I think it helps to reiterate that RAI is not a pegged stablecoin, because its redemption price floats. But to fully understand what this means we need to define a few terms key pertaining to reflex indexes:</p>



<p><strong>Redemption price</strong><br>Redemption price is the price that the protocol wants RAI to have on the secondary market (e.g on Uniswap or Sushiswap). The redemption price is used by Safe users to mint RAI against ETH and it is also used during Global Settlement in order to allow both Safe and RAI users to redeem collateral from the system. The redemption price almost always floats and it does not target any specific peg. <em>[insert Pennywise meme of your choice here]</em></p>



<p><strong>Market price</strong><br>This one&#8217;s a little self-explanatory. This is the price that RAI is traded at on the secondary market.</p>



<p><strong>Redemption rate</strong><br>This is the rate at which RAI is being devalued or revalued. The process of devaluing/revaluing RAI consists in the redemption rate changing the redemption price.</p>



<p><strong>Global settlement</strong><br>Settlement refers to the process of shutting down a reflex index and allowing both Safe and RAI users to redeem collateral from the system. Settlement uses the redemption price (not the market price) to calculate how much collateral can be redeemed by each user.</p>



<p><strong>Borrowing power</strong><br>Borrowing power is how many reflex indexes like RAI can be borrowed against one unit of collateral. Each time the system receives a price feed update for its accepted collateral types, the feed data is divided by the redemption price and then divided again by the liquidation ratio in order to calculate the borrowing power. So for example, if ETH’s price is 100 USD, the liquidation ratio is 145%, and the current index redemption price is 1 USD, the borrowing power for ETH is approximately equal to 100 / 1 / 1.45 = 68.96 USD.</p>



<h3>Let’s dive into a few examples to see what RAI looks like in practice:</h3>



<p>When the market price of RAI is greater than the redemption price for a sustained period of time, the redemption rate becomes negative. A negative redemption rate lowers the redemption price. This results in users’ borrowing power being increased as RAI becomes cheaper inside the protocol. The redemption price continues to lower until the market price reaches it. In other words, this process creates a strong incentive for users to sell their RAI or even leverage their collateral to generate more sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>Now, imagine this process in reverse. When the market price of RAI falls below the redemption price for a long enough period of time, the redemption rate becomes positive. This in turn lowers users’ borrowing power which then causes more users to buy RAI to pay down debt or buy it with the expectation that the market price will follow the redemption price. Likewise, this process continues until the difference between the market and redemption price is reduced to 0.</p>



<p>There are a few interesting caveats to Reflexer worth noting including the fact that the system’s desired steady state may not reduce the redemption rate to 0%. There may be a non-zero redemption rate where the redemption price and market price remain relatively close to one another. Additionally, the system can collect stability fees even when the redemption rate is negative. When a reflex index is being repriced because of the redemption rate, the amount of stability fees collected (denominated in the reflex index) doesn’t change.</p>



<h2>Reflexer’s Ungovernance</h2>



<p>If you haven’t picked up on it yet, Reflexer protocol highly prioritizes trustlessness and in pursuit of that end: governance minimization. Reflexer has laid out a multi-stage process at the end of which governance will not control or be able to upgrade most core contracts and many Reflexer protocol parameters will be set autonomously by other external contracts. Before this process could begin, the following conditions would need to be met first:</p>



<ul><li>Governance must not add or plan to add any more collateral types</li><li>All infrastructure for governance minimization must have been audited and tested in production</li><li>Finally, the system must accrue enough surplus in its main treasury so that it can afford to pay for oracle, PID, state management etc costs for at least 6 months.</li></ul>



<p>The list of components to which can be minimized and automated to varying degrees is far too long for us to cover here, but please refer to <a href="https://docs.reflexer.finance/ungovernance/governance-minimization-guide">Reflexer’s Governance Minimization Guide</a> to learn more. A key takeaway is that the first of 3 Governance Minimization Levels is expected to be reached within 14 months after launch (approx. April 2022).</p>



<p><strong>What does this mean for the average user?</strong> The behavior of RAI and other reflex indexes will be more predictable with defined parameters. Furthermore, developers looking to incorporate reflex indexes into their protocol or smart contract will be able to trust that its behavior won’t change undesirably.</p>



<h2>Interesting possibilities enabled by reflex indexes</h2>



<p>Reflexer’s redemption rate mechanism when put in the hands of DeFi developers could be utilized in all sorts of ways. A prime example being a unique money market design that takes advantage of RAI’s changing redemption rate to offer users better interest rates or speculate on the expected market price of RAI in the future. When viewed as an intrinsic interest rate for RAI, you can start to see how the redemption rate can be incorporated into a whole range of products and services from options to portfolio management strategies. Yield aggregators in particular would benefit from unfiltered access to borrowing power allowing them to remove deposit caps or simply be more capital efficient. RAI’s low volatility also lends itself well to being used as collateral for synthetic asset tokens.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>Reflexer offers crypto-native stability while taking an approach previously left unexplored by the DeFi ecosystem. RAI answers the call for an ETH-backed asset with low volatility which many DeFi users have been calling for since the transition away from single-collateral DAI. Beyond individual users, Reflexer’s goal towards “ungoverned,” unfiltered access to borrowing power could prove to be a useful resource to future DeFi protocols. You could say these are uncharted waters in what might be a blue ocean.</p>



<p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/@me/667142017171849216/813065575466795008">Reflexer</a> went live on mainnet on February 17, 2021.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alpha Homora was a DeFi product born out of practicality. Those familiar with DeFi can tell you that users will go to extraordinary lengths when they spot an opportunity. This proved to be especially true as the yield farming craze reached a fever pitch in 2020 when users would combine various lending protocols to leverage yield farming opportunities. It wasn’t long before <a href="https://alphafinance.io/">Alpha Finance Lab</a> spotted this gap in the market and created Alpha Homora to give users a better way to yield farm with leverage more efficiently while also attempting to minimize the risks involved.</p>



<p>Alpha Homora V2 builds on the popular Alpha Homora V1 yield farming product, supporting more AMM protocols, including Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap, allowing yield farmers to borrow various assets in addition to ETH, and enabling leverage of up to 9x leverage thanks to new partnerships.<strong> </strong><a href="https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/"><strong>Alpha Homora V2</strong></a><strong> is set to launch on Feb 1st.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-1024x549.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8843" width="768" height="412" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-1024x549.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-300x161.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-768x411.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<h2>How does leveraged yield farming work?</h2>



<p>Manually yield farming with leverage required you to take out and manage loans across several lending platforms in what amounted to a nerve-wrecking position that could be extremely hard to ‘unwind’. Using <a href="https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/">Alpha Homora V2</a> is a lot simpler and helps minimize the risks involved (though <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/risk">nothing is risk-free</a>). First, you select a supported liquidity pool from popular exchanges like SushiSwap, Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve that are on Alpha Homora v2 and then supply either or both of the tokens to your desired pool. For example, if you choose the SushiSwap&#8217;s ETH/USDC pool that is on Alpha Homora V2 you can provide ETH, USDC, or both. Note, you don’t need to have equal value of both tokens in order to yield farm with Alpha Homora V2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, you’ll decide whether or not you want to use leverage (which goes up to 9x for selected pools). And then, follow the prompts to confirm and submit your transaction and <em>viola </em>Alpha Homora automagically handles the rest. Users can borrow multiple assets, re-leverage, and deleverage their positions easily in just a few clicks. Compared to doing this process by hand, Alpha Homora can <em>feel like magic.</em> It’s easy to see where the name comes from.</p>



<h1>What’s new in Alpha Homora V2?</h1>



<p>Strong partnerships have shaped the design of Alpha Homora V2. Many of you may have noticed that V2 allows yield farmers to take advantage of significantly more leverage than its predecessor. Behind the scenes, Alpha Homora V2 utilizes CREAM V2’s liquidity to take on leverage for its users. Sometimes referred to as The Iron Bank, CREAM V2 allows whitelisted partner protocols like Alpha Homora V2 to take out loans with less collateral requirements. This results in more leverage for Alpha Homora’s yield farmers and higher interest rates for CREAM V2 users.<br></p>



<p>Alpha Finance Labs worked closely with its partners to enable leveraged yield farming of liquidity pools on Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap. And in an effort to help strengthen its partners’ communities, Alpha Homora V2 will not automatically sell and reinvest the farmed tokens. <strong>At launch, Alpha Homora V2 will feature the following leveraged farming pools:</strong></p>



<p><strong>New leveraged pools:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Curve’s 3pool (USDT, USDC, DAI)</li><li>Balancer’s PERP/USDC</li></ul>



<p><strong>Pools migrated from V1:</strong></p>



<ul><li>SushiSwap’s ETH/SUSHI</li><li>Uniswap’s ETH/UNI</li></ul>



<p>In a nutshell, farmers will be able to leverage USDT, USDC, DAI, and ETH to farm CRV, PERP, or SUSHI tokens with up to 9x leverage. On the flipside, lenders will be able to lend ETH, USDT, USDC, and DAI on day one to start earning interest. The plan is to continue to add even more new pools and migrate more pools from V1 over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those curious, be sure to check out these fantastic posts written by the Alpha Finance team that walks you through Alpha Homora V2 from the perspective of <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-in-yield-farmers-perspectives/">yield farmers</a> and <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-in-lenders-perspectives/">lenders</a>. Alpha Homora is also offering additional yield in the form of ALPHA rewards for both farmers. See <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/liquidity-mining-part-2a">here</a> for more information.</p>



<h2>Migrating to V2</h2>



<p>To ensure a smooth transition, ALPHA rewards will continue for a limited time for those liquidity mining on Alpha Homora V1. Although farmers should be aware that leveraged positions on Alpha Homora v2 will get more rewards compared to those on V1. This creates an incentive to migrate sooner rather than later. Here’s <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/72-hour-countdown/">a step-by-step guide</a> for those looking to migrate.</p>



<h2>What is ibETHv2?</h2>



<p>When you lend out an asset on Alpha Homora, you receive the corresponding ibToken or interest bearing token. ibETHv2 is an interest-bearing ETH token you receive when lending ETH to Alpha Homora V2. Alpha Homora typically has competitive yields for ETH due to the high demand from its leverage yield farming pools. Alpha Finance Lab also runs a <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/trading-volume-mining-part-2b">Trading Volume Mining</a> program which rewards users for supplying liquidity to ibETH/ALPHA and ibETHv2/ALPHA pools.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/o7JpNF2vwiZxUlXbPbEtUtMMlbqUwQM-KpKE5OSCqCYH0jEBrzXPKlkjlCp1E7fk5JD8rQx5sGaQqQaShoaL1BF8_FuqNWS_yV7z5qzmfbBNjFw_L6otv5Yzlfeo2yw2RYBZgEsm" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The ibETHv2/ALPHA pool on SushiSwap <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/72-hour-countdown/">goes live on Feb 3rd</a>. Liquidity providers of this pool will receive ALPHA rewards as well as SUSHI tokens from SushiSwap’s Onsen program. Rewards from Alpha Finance’s Trading Volume Mining program will be reflected in the form of trading fees APY when you remove liquidity (not airdropped to your wallet). Those providing liquidity to the ibETH/ALPHA pool on Uniswap will still receive rewards until Feb 3rd, 1pm UTC.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>Alpha Finance Lab’s initial release of Alpha Homora was well-received by the DeFi community given the immediate utility it provided to yield farmers. Alpha Homora V2 built on this popular platform to provide more utility for its users and value for its partner protocols. Key partnerships like the utilization of CREAM V2’s Iron Bank will allow Alpha Homora V2’s users to achieve higher levels of capital efficiency. It’s undeniable we’ve entered a new era in DeFi where partnerships can give you an edge more now than ever. So it will be very interesting to see how such a deep protocol level partnership influences the future growth of both platforms. Regardless of how things pan out, Alpha Homora V2 users will reap the benefits in the meantime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In traditional finance, leaner banking models without physical locations allowed online banks to cut costs and pass the benefits onto the customer. Banking services built on decentralized networks like Ethereum can offer even more advantages by further reducing operational costs such as securing assets which would traditionally be held in custody. Non-custodial protocols like DeFiner allow users to access savings and loans anytime, anywhere with an internet connection putting you in control of your money.</p>



<p><a href="https://definer.org/">DeFiner</a> is a non-custodial protocol which aims to be a better banking experience than traditional banks by making full use of the disruptive innovations happening in DeFi. Since its founding in 2018, DeFiner has gone on to <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/79450/definerorg-wins-detroit-fintech-challenge/">win the Detroit Fintech Challenge in August 2019</a> and participated in the <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/announcing-the-inaugural-class-of-techstars-hub71-accelerator">Techstars Accelerator</a> and Microsoft Startup Program. Partnerships with both names from traditional tech firms like Microsoft and Consensus Labs as well as names from DeFi like Wyre and Kyber have helped DeFiner move closer towards its goal. DeFiner envisions a complete range of DeFi banking services starting with its first two products: peer-to-peer lending and DeFi savings.</p>

<h2>DeFiner’s Taurus savings takes advantage of existing money legos</h2>



<p>DeFiner <a href="https://blog.definer.org/taurus-launch">launched Taurus Savings Accounts</a> in late November 2020. Taurus Savings Accounts work similar to DeFi money markets you’re likely familiar with. You can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow against your collateral. While loans on the DeFiner protocol are overcollateralized, DeFiner takes advantage of existing DeFi protocols to offer its users borrowing and lending interest rates typically better than the industry average. You see DeFiner takes a portion of the collateral held in its reserves and lends it out on popular money markets like Compound or Maker to earn interest. In other words, DeFiner increases capital utilization to up to more than 85% to reduce the spread between borrowing and lending rates. </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that while this does indeed lower the spread, it comes at the cost of added composability and economic risks. Imagine a scenario where the value of a collateral asset drops quickly or a bug is found and exploited and Compound is unable to cover existing debts. This in turn may mean DeFiner could also be left with insufficient collateral unable to cover existing debts.</p>



<p>When things don’t go as planned, DeFiner allows borrowers to pay back their loans with their collateral. Triggering a self-liquidation sells your desired collateral at a 2% discount in order to cover your debt and avoid a forced liquidation, which bears a 5% collateral discount. Both discounted rates are designed to attract liquidators to participate in collateral auctions and ensure debts can reliably be covered in a timely manner.</p>



<p>DeFiner protocol uses its native token FIN to reward its most active users as well as incentivize users to help meet demand in highly sought after lending markets like USDC and DAI. DeFiner protocol releases new FIN tokens via its Proof of Premium (POP) distribution mechanism. Proof of Premium verifies the premium the prover (lenders and borrowers) generated in a specified time interval. To sum up POP, the more capital committed by a user for longer time periods and higher interest rates results in more FIN tokens being rewarded through the POP mining mechanism. FIN token holders can vote on the follow four categories: lending platform changes (i.e. loan to collateral value ratios, transaction fees, etc.), determining how platform fees are distributed, determining the distribution of FIN token rewards, and electing the board of directors for the DeFiner Organization, a non-profit entity which maintains and promotes the growth of the DeFiner lending platform and community. Currently, 100% of transaction fees and 10% of all interest generated by loans on the DeFiner protocol are distributed to FIN token holders. Learn more about FIN token and Proof of Premium <a href="https://github.com/DeFinerOrg/whitepaper/wiki/DeFiner-Whitepaper#definer-token-fin-economy">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>Decentralized finance has been a series of innovations each one building on the next. That’s why it’s nice to see DeFiner exploring ways to utilize secondary money markets to improve its own money market for the benefit of its users. DeFiner plans to release a mobile app in the future. With the ever increasing popularity of mobile banking, this feels like a natural progression of DeFiner’s mission to reduce friction for users. <a href="https://twitter.com/definerorg">Follow DeFiner on Twitter</a> to keep up with the latest updates. And if you’re curious how DeFiner’s design impacts interest rates, we urge you to check out <a href="https://app.definer.org/">Taurus</a> and compare it to other popular lending platforms.

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As any yield farmer can tell you, chasing higher yields can be a risky endeavour and in most cases is not a sustainable strategy for the average user. It’s all too easy to get caught up in hype and be blinded by outrageous yields. If you aren’t careful or are simply unaware of risks such as hidden backdoors in unaudited smart contracts, it becomes increasingly possible that you could get burned. Getting exploited, “rug pulled”, and otherwise losing your investment is devastating. This sort of risk is intolerable for most investors. Although, that doesn’t mean those same investors aren’t out to maximize their yields; They simply want to strike the right balance of risk versus reward. This is exactly what <a href="https://www.rari.capital/">Rari Capital</a> aims to offer users: a way to maximize DeFi returns while minimizing risks. <strong>Rari Capital V2, launching October 20th, 2020, has even more to offer than its predecessor.<br></strong><br>Rari Capital is a robo-advisor for DeFi which optimizes for the highest possible yield. Rari Capital&#8217;s ‘DeRisking as a Service’ approach is largely what sets them apart from the pack. Armed with the experience of having co-founded Ambo (later acquired by MyCrypto), the Rari team has experienced first-hand the value of earning the community’s trust. So when they set out to build a protocol that anyone can use to maximize returns in DeFi, risk management and transparency were top priorities. If you haven’t already, we recommend checking out <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/rari-capital/">our coverage of Rari Capital V1’s guarded launch</a>.<br><br>The Rari team has been busy since we last checked in with them developing features and integrations, perfecting new strategies, and preparing for the<strong> </strong>launch of Rari Capital V2.</p>



<h2>Goodbye deposit limits</h2>



<p>As part of its guarded launch, Rari V1 launched with deposit limits designed to manage risks and grow the platform in a controlled manner. Thorough <a href="https://www.rari.capital/risks.html">risk assessment</a> for integrations and transparency have also been core components of Rari’s guarded launch allowing the team to gradually increase the deposit limits over time. Rari is <a href="https://quantstamp.com/blog/chasing-yield-with-defi-aggregators">working with Quantstamp</a> on several security reviews. <strong>Rari Capital has since removed deposit limits. </strong></p>



<h2>New integrations enable higher yields</h2>



<p>Since the launch of Rari Capital V1, <a href="https://medium.com/rari-capital/rari-capital-integrates-aave-fa2574a15a3a">Aave</a> and mStable have been integrated into the protocol. It doesn’t stop there though; Rari Capital V2 goes beyond lending protocols and stablecoin swaps to achieve higher returns for its users. In the past few weeks, Rari’s theoretical APY has spiked as high as 109%, thanks in part to the recent mStable integration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/z6Fuc0bQhXYIz75pRi-w5hIfH5A4NRLHJm-sqAJ6Aa95BydKOwv5zZ0fjnEQu1vyE4_Ik0wwAzpJuRDw8jXTbGLAeofiYSL-G2wo1dKFN7lHI0piviCrcaXq0gLc4WpgN4WIyBOj" alt=""/></figure>



<p><br>The Rari team continues to explore new integrations to optimize pool strategies including yEarn and <a href="https://medium.com/rari-capital/rari-capital-x-synthetix-48413e50a56e">Synthetix</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3 Pools with Unique Strategies</h2>



<p>Rari is introducing 3 pools with strategies that cater to different risk appetites. The Rari team is also working on even more new strategies that will be able to weather any crypto market conditions generating sustainable yields.</p>



<p><strong>Rari Stable Pool (RSPT)</strong></p>



<p>This pool caters to the risk-averse investor seeking to maximize their USD-based returns with caution, making use of exclusively audited smart contracts in its strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Rari Yield Pool (RYPT)</strong></p>



<p>Are you willing to risk it for the biscuit as they say? This pool will always have the highest yield utilizing anything from unaudited smart contracts to even leverage in order to maximize your returns at all costs. You can think of this pool as: higher risk, higher reward.</p>



<p><strong>Rari ETH Pool (REPT)</strong></p>



<p>If you’re the type of person that measures their net worth in ETH, this pool is for you. The Rari ETH Pool aims to provide consistent returns based in ETH.</p>



<h2>Rari Governance&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The upgrade to version 2.0 also introduces decentralized governance to Rari Capital via Rari Governance Tokens (RGT). RGT holders will decide how to govern the protocol and the Rari Treasury, determining new protocols integrations, pool parameters, and risk parameters. RGT can be staked to receive fee discounts from the Rari Protocol, a feature powered by Chainlink. Rari Capital V2 is designed so that 70% of all protocol revenue will be used to buy and burn RGT, reducing the total supply.</p>



<h3>Passthrough Governance</h3>



<p>Rari’s governance has a cool feature called ‘Passthrough Governance’ where if a pool begins to accumulate tokens such as COMP or BAL, RGT holders can use these tokens to engage in their respective governance systems. It’s a practical solution that mitigates the current shortcoming found in other protocols where users must sacrifice the ability to engage with token governance in order to utilize an automated strategy. As Rari continues to integrate more and more protocols, this feature may become more important over time. Some protocols issue rewards for participating in governance which means this feature could potentially be used as part of a yield generating strategy at some point in the future.</p>



<h3>Liquidity Mining</h3>



<p>87.50% of RGT will be distributed over a 60 day period via a liquidity mining program set to start on October 20th, 2020 with the launch of Rari Capital V2. The remaining RGT is reserved for the Rari team and is subject to a vesting schedule. <strong>For full details, we recommend reading </strong><a href="https://medium.com/rari-capital/announcing-rgt-the-long-term-yield-token-b2593502a7f3"><strong>the RGT announcement post</strong></a><strong>. It’s worth noting that while the distribution will last 60 days nearly half of the tokens will be distributed in the first 15 days. Additionally, “there is a ‘burn’ as a user when you attempt to transfer your $RGT before the 60-day distribution schedule is expired.”</strong></p>



<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>



<p>Rari Capital V2 further cements its product-market fit by offering more to users of any risk appetite. Whether you’re looking to earn risk-minimized returns on idle ETH or stablecoins or you’d rather chase the highest yields, Rari Capital’s sophisticated robo-advisor can be an effective tool in your arsenal. And it’s safe to expect more pools and integrations on the horizon, especially with the introduction of community governance. It’ll also be curious to see how the community chooses to govern the protocol and in what ways they may evolve each strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Rari Capital V2 is set to launch on October 20th, 2020</strong>. Be sure to check it out at <a href="https://app.rari.capital/">Rari Capital</a> when the time comes and <a href="https://twitter.com/Raricapital">follow them on Twitter</a> in the meantime to hear the latest regarding the launch of V2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This past year has been an incredible time of maturation and expansion for decentralized finance. Familiar protocols have seen increased adoption, cementing the foundation on which the whirlwind of new projects have been built. Our community has multiplied in numbers. Countless newcomers are venturing down the DeFi rabbit hole where it is easy to get lost in the numerous technological and economic terms and concepts you must learn. The whole experience can be ultimately overwhelming because not only is DeFi expanding wider, it is also getting deeper.<br><br>As DeFi grows larger with more complex and moving parts, it’s important that we have the tools necessary to safely sustain said growth. Each new user, token, feature, project, or protocol adds a variable that users need to take into account when weighing the risks of the protocols that they use. It’s difficult to say the least for users, new and old, to properly assess and compare economic risk across protocols. DeFi Pulse has long been an advocate for user safety and educating users about risk because informed users make informed decisions which results in a healthier ecosystem. And so, we’ve partnered with financial simulation experts at Gauntlet to provide a simpler way to inform users of risk: DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade.</p>



<h2><strong>DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade, as the name implies, is a 1 to 100 grade that allows users to more easily quantify and compare the economic risks of using on-chain protocols. Grades are created by running simulations utilizing data from centralized and decentralized exchanges combined with on-chain user data to estimate market risks. For a more in-depth explanation of the simulation model, we recommend you read this <a href="https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/understanding-risk-in-defi-f64574593979">blog post from Gauntlet</a>.</p>



<p>At launch, safety grades are primarily focused on the risk of insolvency for decentralized protocols or, in other words, the risk to the depositor.  Lending protocols are a perfect starting point because they are one of the most popular DeFi applications and have many compounding variables. Gauntlet’s simulations assess four key factors: user behavior, collateral volatility, relative collateral liquidity, protocol parameters. All of these risk factors combined are practically impossible for the average user to evaluate. Our position in the community allows us to take Gauntlet’s sophisticated models and communicate them in a digestible format for a wide audience. The net result of which we hope is a safer DeFi ecosystem full of users mindful of risk.</p>



<p><strong>Safety grades are now available for </strong><a href="https://defipulse.com/aave"><strong>Aave</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://defipulse.com/compound"><strong>Compound</strong></a><strong> on DeFi Pulse.</strong> In this initial alpha, these grades are formed by analyzing the historical liquidity and volatility data to find the &#8216;riskiest collateral&#8217;. Then, the risk of the system for users borrowing stablecoins against this collateral is estimated and normalized to create the 1 to 100 grade you see on DeFi Pulse. The higher the grade, the higher the economic safety the protocol.</p>
