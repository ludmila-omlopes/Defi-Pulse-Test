										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Imagine you&#8217;re trying out a new DeFi project. Everything is going smoothly; the instructions on screen guide you, making you feel confident in your actions. That is until you complete your transaction and then your tokens don&#8217;t arrive. You start to get that sinking feeling in your stomach as you realize you&#8217;ve received tokens the wrong tokens&#8230;</p>



<p>Looking at your transaction confirmation you realize you received a token with the same name and ticker symbol as the one you thought you selected. In fact, upon reviewing the token selection menu you realize there are lots of inaccurate and confusing tokens listed. It&#8217;s a simple mistake but costly mistake anyone could make that leaves a sour taste in your mouth about the whole experience.</p>



<h4>So what happened?</h4>



<p>On Ethereum, anyone can create a token with any name or ticker symbol. It&#8217;s not like registering a username on a website; there&#8217;s no native mechanism preventing a new token from having the same name, symbol, or even icon as an existing token. Whether intentionally or not, duplicate or misleading tokens are created all the time making mistakes like the one described above more and more likely to occur for even the most experienced users.</p>



<p>Not to mention, DeFi grows so quickly that it&#8217;s practically impossible to keep up with the countless new tokens being produced by projects. DAI alone has over 30 variations. This situation isn&#8217;t slowing down anytime soon and a lot of collective time is being spent in our community right now playing detective in order to determine if a token is the right token.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/05/token-list-thumb-1-wo-padding.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8247" width="638" height="638"/></a></figure></div>



<h2>Meet The Token List</h2>



<p>The Token List provides an accurate list of authentic tokens submitted and curated by the community. Its purpose is to create a standard list of tokens that everyone can rely on. <strong>Anyone can apply to have a token added to The Token List as long as it isn’t likely to be confused with previously listed or well-known tokens. And, it&#8217;s free for anyone to integrate The Token List into their project.</strong></p>



<p>A reliable well-vetted token list serves as a source of truth for the community helping ensure users are never confused by misleading tokens or outright scams. The idea is that when you see a platform is using The Token List, you can be confident that the tokens available are the real deal.</p>



<h3>Implementation is fast, easy and forever free</h3>



<p>Integrating The Token List into your project is simple and worry-free with little to no maintenance. <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a> lets your team work smarter, not harder. No more wasting man hours on listing new tokens on top of maintaining the ever-growing list of existing tokens. And best of all, <strong>it&#8217;s forever free to use</strong> &#8211; no upfront cost or ongoing fees.</p>



<p>The Token List provides all the relevant information for each authentic token in JSON format: </p>



<ul><li>token name</li><li>contract address </li><li>ticker symbol </li><li>decimals</li><li>icon image</li><li>token standard (ERC20, ERC223, etc)</li><li>and flags describing token qualities such as: is it used in governance, is it a social token, etc.</li></ul>



<p>We handle the listing and maintenance for you so you can get back to building what matters.</p>



<h4>Got a token? Apply to The Token List in a snap.</h4>



<p>As previously mentioned, anyone can submit an application to list any authentic token to The Token List. Simply, visit <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a>, click the &#8216;Add a Token now!&#8217; button (powered by Unlock Protocol). It costs a flat fee of 0.05 ETH to apply. And then, follow the prompts to fill out the simple form with the required token details. </p>



<p>We review all applications for authenticity and to ensure that they are unique enough to not confuse the average user. We want to help improve user experience, not act as gatekeepers, so we&#8217;ll err on the side of inclusion where possible (but for the safety of the community we do reserve the right to reject outright scams or tokens intending to mislead, etc).</p>



<h3>Adaptive token selection</h3>



<p>Opening up the token listing process benefits all involved by making UX/UIs become more responsive and inclusive. Instead of acting as a potential gatekeepers, DeFi projects now become advocates of collaboration and empower their community to take ownership of the token listing process. Additionally, the community lends their watchful eyes to help maintain the accuracy and authenticity of existing token listings (because we know how fast some things change in DeFi).</p>



<h3>Collaboration and composability</h3>



<p>The ability to connect and combine existing smart contracts to create something new is a defining aspect of DeFi. We&#8217;re an industry built on collaboration which increases the pace of innovation. Projects and users alike benefit from keeping this shared list of tokens up-to-date with the latest listings and changes to existing tokens, potentially serving as a catalyst for even more composability between DeFi projects. Naturally, it&#8217;s easier to work together when you&#8217;re all on the same page. For example: when one project submits their newest token, it&#8217;s automatically added to all projects using The Token List.</p>



<h2>Take advantage of The Token List today</h2>



<p>Whether you&#8217;re hacking together an idea, tired of maintaining your current token listings, or want to make your token known to the world, <a href="https://defipulse.com/token-list">The Token List</a> is a simple but effective solution to meet your needs.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re really excited for this release and the potential impact an open, accessible standard token list could have on DeFi. Standards can improve quality of life and safety for users and make developers&#8217; work easier and more efficient. We&#8217;re also interested to see how this list will grow with community input. We&#8217;re 100% open to new ideas like new descriptive flags. So please let us know what you think on <a href="https://twitter.com/defipulse">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://discord.gg/Gx4TCTk">Discord</a>, and <a href="https://t.me/defipulse">Telegram</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DeFi doesn&#8217;t just stand for decentralized finance; DeFi is a community of users, developers, investors, traders, researchers, writers, and so much more. Our collective endeavors are etched into the blockchain; our stories and shared history can be found in our data.</p>



<p>Ask anyone who&#8217;s familiar with DeFi and they&#8217;ll tell you that it&#8217;s been exhilarating to be a part of. Week by week, we&#8217;ve crossed milestones, set new records, and broken new ground. We set goals and then build towards them until they are fulfilled. Our community takes data from the blockchain and translates it into meaningful events that represent our community&#8217;s story and what it values.</p>



<p>At Concourse Open, we&#8217;ve witnessed this firsthand with our Total Value Locked metric. When we built DeFi Pulse a little over a year ago, we could have never imagined how well it would be received by the community. So many stories have been told with our data and illustrated with our charts. </p>

</div><figcaption><em>Graphic made using data from DeFi Pulse Data</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>We want everyone to have access to the data they need. <a href="https://data.defipulse.com/">DeFi Pulse Data</a> combines its popular DeFi metrics with data from Concourse Open&#8217;s other popular services&#8217; APIs like ETHGasStation and Rekto which thousands of users, websites, and applications rely upon everyday to understand the decentralized ecosystem. Most notably, Ethereum gas price data provided by ETHGasStation’s API has become essential for decentralized application (DApp) developers. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="https://data.defipulse.com/"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8212" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-1536x864.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social-1568x882.png 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/04/defipulse-data-social.png 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></a></figure>



<p>We understand how valuable accurate data can be when it comes to making informed decisions or effectively accomplishing a task. That&#8217;s why anyone can try DeFi Pulse Data and access all of its comprehensive data sets by simply <a href="https://data.defipulse.com/">signing up for a free account</a>. Because, we know the right data in the right hands can have a big impact on our community. </p>



<h3>How we utilize data determines our past, present, and future.</h3>



<p>The way we frame and interpret data points can tell a story, justify a design choice, confirm a hypothesize, and much much more. And when you examine our community, it couldn&#8217;t be clearer that our data represents our past actions but what we create  with that data determines our future.</p>



<p>We share in the triumph of moments like when the total value locked (TVL) in DeFi broke $1 Billion. We cheer together however our eyes are still looking toward the future.</p>

<p>We see that 1 BILLION and want to build bigger and better things to get to that next billion. The data taps into something deeply rooted in our brains and inspires us to keep moving forward.</p>



<p>And when times get tough, we look to the data to determine what happened and how to proceed.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DeFi-Dive-Social-Media-ren.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8018" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DeFi-Dive-Social-Media-ren.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DeFi-Dive-Social-Media-ren-300x150.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/DeFi-Dive-Social-Media-ren-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><strong><em>In this edition of DeFi Dive, Michael W. Burgess, Ren&#8217;s Head of Operations, discusses their team&#8217;s journey of bringing interoperability to DeFi.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>I got into crypto early 2017 and one of the most obvious issues at that time was the lack of decentralized interoperability. </p>



<p>To this day there are lots of solutions out there to trade BTC for ETH/ERC20s/etc but none that embodied the whole point of crypto: trustlessness, permissionless, decentralization, and privacy. </p>



<p>With RenVM, smart contracts on any blockchain can control tokens on other blockchains, allowing DeFi to leverage the liquidity available anywhere and everywhere. It does all this without compromising trustlessness, permissionless, decentralization, or privacy.</p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>In the simplest terms, RenVM brings interoperability to DeFi. </p>



<p>The advantage over other solutions is its generic interoperability; meaning it works with any blockchain, not just a one-off solution. We already support BTC, BCH, and ZEC; with many more to come. </p>



<p>You can think of RenVM as a Tesla with over-the-air updates. Anytime we upgrade, add a feature, or new blockchain; applications that utilize RenVM will receive these benefits without lifting a finger. </p>



<p>Further, RenVM is composable. Meaning it serves as a plug-in for decentralized finance and therefore, any DeFi application can easily incorporate RenVM’s capabilities into their applications and existing smart contracts.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>DeFi Applications such as DEXes, Lending, Leveraging, etc</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>RenVM Mainnet is right around the corner, so we are working hard to bring it to fruition.</p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>With RenVM, a new narrative for the blockchain ecosystem rises. DeFi is no longer constrained, and a world of trustless value transfer exchange (regardless of blockchain) is born. </p>



<p>Bringing any digital assets to DeFi (Ethereum) regardless of blockchain, will have a profound impact on its dominance and ultimately solidify its role as the world&#8217;s settlement layer. International commerce is built on trust and given the world’s current fragmentation and lack thereof, it is one of the most important trust layer projects in existence today. </p>



<p>RenVM will help usher in this new paradigm.</p>



<h3>What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>The potential of composability is really quite exciting. </p>



<p>What DeFi will be able to achieve in a year&#8217;s time will dwarf the products traditional finance can offer. This is a really important step in an industry&#8217;s maturation.</p>



<h3>How can readers learn more about your product/service?</h3>



<p>Come find us on <a href="http://twitter.com/renprotocol">Twitter</a> and get excited because 2020 will be an exciting time.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DAI is an ERC20 token designed to maintain a peg to the US Dollar, also known as a stablecoin, generated and maintained by the <a href="https://makerdao.com/">Maker Protocol</a>. Every single DAI in existence has been generated by users <a href="https://defipulse.com/maker">locking collateral into Maker&#8217;s smart contract system</a> and opening what&#8217;s called a Vault.</p>



<p>When you open a Maker Vault, you lock in collateral such as ether (ETH) or BAT. And then, you’re able to generate or borrow up to 2/3 of the US dollar value of your collateral in DAI. In other words, your Vault&#8217;s ratio of collateral value to total debt in DAI must be above 150%.</p>



<p>For every 1 DAI, there is at least $1.50 worth of collateral locked into a Maker Vault. And if your collateral value falls, you must lock in more ETH, pay back some of your debt, or risk having the collateral in your Vault liquidated. When a Vault position is liquidated, the held collateral is automatically sold to pay back the debts in addition to a penalty fee for failing to keep your collateral ratio above 150%.</p>



<h2>Using Maker&#8217;s Oasis portal to borrow your first DAI</h2>



<p><strong>Navigate to Maker&#8217;s <a href="https://oasis.app/borrow">Oasis Borrow</a>.</strong><br>There are many ways to interface with a Maker Vault; Oasis is <a href="https://github.com/OasisDEX">open-source</a> and was developed by the Maker. </p>



<p><strong>Connect the wallet of your choice and click &#8216;Get Started&#8217;</strong><br><a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> is a browser extension commonly recommended for interacting with many DApps. Ledger and Trezor are hardware wallets. Wallet Connect and Coinbase Wallet allow you to scan a QR code to access Oasis via mobile wallet.</p>

<h3>What can I use DAI for?</h3>



<p>DAI is one of the most liquid assets in the DeFi ecosystem. You can spend, save, lend, and tons more with your DAI. You can trade DAI for ETH, MKR, and many other ERC20 tokens at the best prices in DeFi using a DEX aggregator like <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a>.</p>



<p>You can <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">earn interest</a> by lending out your DAI on other DeFi lending protocols. Remember to keep in mind the stability fees you&#8217;ll owe on any DAI you generate or borrow from your Vault. And also, consider the various risks involved in lending some of which we cover in our <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/zero-to-defi-cdai/">Zero to DeFi</a> guide.</p>



<p>Another way to earn interest is to deposit DAI into Maker&#8217;s <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/dsr-dai-savings-rate/">Dai Savings Rate</a> (DSR). The DSR allows users to lock in DAI to earn a variable interest rate. However, don&#8217;t go generating DAI just to deposit it into the DSR because the DSR is designed to be lower than the stability fee. <a href="https://oasis.app/save">Learn more</a> about the Dai Savings Rate.</p>



<p>You&#8217;d be surprised the many interesting ways you can use your DAI! Explore <a href="https://github.com/makerdao/awesome-makerdao#dai-1">a full list of ecosystem resources</a> composed by the Maker community.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CDP stands for Collateralized Debt Position. In laymen&#8217;s terms, it&#8217;s when you put up assets as collateral in order to take out a loan or debt against said collateral. When you&#8217;re talking about Ethereum, a CDP specifically refers to a position or loan taken out in DAI through the <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MakerDAO</a> smart contract which is backed by ETH.</p>
<p>When you open a MakerDAO CDP, you lock in ether (ETH) as collateral. And then, you&#8217;re able to mint up to 2/3 of the US dollar value of your ether in DAI, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. In other words, your CDP must have at least 150% more collateral value than your total debt in DAI.</p>
<p>CDP holders pay an annual interest rate on their debts called the stability fee for the opportunity to mint new DAI. And when the debt is repaid, the DAI is burned along with the stability fee owed in Maker&#8217;s token MKR. The stability fee deters users from over-inflating the total supply of DAI.</p>
<p>For every 1 DAI, there is at least $1.50 worth of Ether (ETH) locked into a Maker CDP as collateral. And if your collateral value falls, you must lock in more ETH, pay back some of your debt, or risk having their CDP liquidated. When a CDP is liquidated, the ETH held as collateral is automatically sold to pay back the debts in addition to a penalty fee for failing to keep your collateral ratio above 150%.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_7544" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7544" style="width: 1000px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7544" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/makerdao-cdp-portal-1024x576.jpg" alt="CDP" width="1000" height="563" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-7544" class="wp-caption-text">MakerDAO&#8217;s CDP Portal</figcaption></figure></p>
<h2>How do I open a CDP?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s quick and easy to open a CDP. Just head on over to MakerDAO&#8217;s <a href="https://cdp.makerdao.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Portal</a>, send a few transactions&#8230; and then BAM! You&#8217;re the proud owner of a CDP.</p>
<p>First, connect your wallet and the menu will guide you through sending the transaction to open your CDP. Once you&#8217;ve opened your CDP, you&#8217;ll need to add some ETH to your CDP with the <em>&#8216;Deposit&#8217;</em> button. Next, click the <em>&#8216;Generate&#8217;</em> button to mint your desired amount of DAI.</p>
<p>And when you want to pay your debt back, return to this portal and use the &#8216;Pay Back&#8217; button. Don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t have MKR for the stability fee because you can also pay it back with DAI. Now, you have the option to withdraw your collateral. Also, you can either close your CDP entirely or leave it open for later borrowing, it&#8217;s your choice.</p>
<p>Remember to keep in mind that you will owe interest on any DAI you borrow. Additionally, you won&#8217;t be able to access any ether you lock up in your CDP until your debt is paid. And if the price of ETH begins to fall, you may become at risk of liquidation if you don&#8217;t take action. We recommend you do not borrow the maximum amount possible and instead consider borrowing a smaller amount to reduce your risk of liquidation.</p>
<h2>Why open a CDP?</h2>
<p>The easy answer is: to have access to DAI. While the price of ETH may fluctuate, you can count on DAI to hover around $1. So there&#8217;s a natural demand for DAI in payments, commerce, games, lending, and many many more use cases. DAI has also become the de facto stablecoin for <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/best-decentralized-exchanges-dexes/">decentralized exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>The more complicated answer is that there are a number of reasons you might want to borrow against your ETH. Maybe you want the DAI to pay off other bills in your life but you don&#8217;t want to sell your ETH. Or, maybe you want to mint DAI to leverage yourself by purchasing other investments. There are numerous reasons you might want liquidity while still being exposed to the price of ETH.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the past, users had to rely on centralized exchanges to trade their cryptocurrency. But, things have come a long way since then and you have other options. And, nowadays decentralized exchanges provide users with a competitive alternative.</p>
<h3>Not sure what decentralized exchanges are?</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s okay if you&#8217;re unfamilar with what decentralized exchanges are. Here&#8217;s a helpful explainer you can read to learn <a href="/blog/what-is-a-decentralized-exchange/">what a DEX is</a>.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got a grasp of the basics, let&#8217;s move onto a few examples. We&#8217;ve put together a list of some innovative and popular DEXes that people like to use in the Ethereum community.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7455 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/uniswaplogo.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></h3>
<h3>Uniswap</h3>
<p>Funded by an Ethereum Foundation grant and launched in November 2018, Uniswap is one of the most popular decentralized exchanges and is known for its wide selection of trading pairs. Uniswap&#8217;s code is open source and it has no investor tokens.</p>
<p>Uniswap&#8217;s smart contract let&#8217;s you swap ETH or ERC-20 tokens on-chain by pooling liquidity. Each swap is charged a 0.03% liquidity fee which is added to the pool incentivizing users to contribute equal parts ETH and ERC-20.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7457 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/kyberswaplogo.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></h3>
<h3>KyberSwap</h3>
<p>KyberSwap&#8217;s a DEX that allows users to swap tokens, powered by the Kyber Network. Kyber Network, a liquidity protocol which aggregates liquidity reserves, held an ICO for its KNC token in late Q3 2017. Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) tokens have a variety of uses on the Kyber Network.</p>
<p>For example, each swap performed on the Kyber Network require the fees to be paid in KNC which is then burned. Paying your fees in KNC gives you a discount. Otherwise, the smart contract swaps part of your payment for the KNC to pay the fee. KNC&#8217;s also needed to open your own liquidity reserve to earn on the Kyber Network.</p>
<p>KyberSwap recently added the option to place limit order trades. No deposit is required and you receive a 50% discount on the 0.1% fee when you pay in KNC.</p>
<h3><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7456 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/radarrelaylogo-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/radarrelaylogo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/08/radarrelaylogo.jpg 269w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></h3>
<h3>Radar Relay</h3>
<p>Radar Relay is the most popular 0x protocol relayer. With the 0x trading protocol, users submit signed trade order. Users&#8217; orders are kept in orderbooks off-chain and eventually all trades settle on-chain.</p>
<p>Those who keep orderbooks are called relayers because they relay signed orders off-chain. When the order is taken off the book, the other party signs the pre-signed order transaction. And then, the transaction&#8217;s submitted and the funds transfer from their wallets.</p>
<p>And, one of the best parts is that there are no sign-ups, deposits, and currently no fees. Radar Relay offers an experience more reminiscent of traditional exchanges. There&#8217;s no fees to place limit orders; Only trades that take orders off the books, or taker orders.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7176 size-thumbnail alignleft" src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo-150x150.jpg" alt="Dex.Ag" width="150" height="150" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dex.ag-logo.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></p>
<h3>DEX.AG</h3>
<p><a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> is a free site that searches over 10 of the most popular DEXes for the best price, saving you time and money. Instead of having to run around to each individual site, DEX.AG scans Uniswap, Kyberswap, Radar Relay, Eth2Dai, and loads more DEXes for the best price for your trade.</p>
<p>Simply, enter the token and quantity of what you&#8217;re looking to buy or sell and DEX.AG finds you the best deal. And if you hit the &#8216;Buy Now&#8217; button, DEX.AG will walk you through completing your trade via MetaMask or your web3 browser wallet.</p>
<p>And best of all, you and your trade are interacting directly with the DEX&#8217;s smart contract. So, there are no additional fees on top of fee of your selected exchange.</p>
<h3>Thanks for reading</h3>
<p>Good luck finding the right decentralized exchange for you. And if you have any questions, we&#8217;re here to help in our Discord.</p>
