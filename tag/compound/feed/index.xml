<p>In traditional finance, leaner banking models without physical locations allowed online banks to cut costs and pass the benefits onto the customer. Banking services built on decentralized networks like Ethereum can offer even more advantages by further reducing operational costs such as securing assets which would traditionally be held in custody. Non-custodial protocols like DeFiner allow users to access savings and loans anytime, anywhere with an internet connection putting you in control of your money.</p>



<p><a href="https://definer.org/">DeFiner</a> is a non-custodial protocol which aims to be a better banking experience than traditional banks by making full use of the disruptive innovations happening in DeFi. Since its founding in 2018, DeFiner has gone on to <a href="https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/79450/definerorg-wins-detroit-fintech-challenge/">win the Detroit Fintech Challenge in August 2019</a> and participated in the <a href="https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/announcing-the-inaugural-class-of-techstars-hub71-accelerator">Techstars Accelerator</a> and Microsoft Startup Program. Partnerships with both names from traditional tech firms like Microsoft and Consensus Labs as well as names from DeFi like Wyre and Kyber have helped DeFiner move closer towards its goal. DeFiner envisions a complete range of DeFi banking services starting with its first two products: peer-to-peer lending and DeFi savings.</p>

<h2>DeFiner’s Taurus savings takes advantage of existing money legos</h2>



<p>DeFiner <a href="https://blog.definer.org/taurus-launch">launched Taurus Savings Accounts</a> in late November 2020. Taurus Savings Accounts work similar to DeFi money markets you’re likely familiar with. You can deposit assets to earn interest or borrow against your collateral. While loans on the DeFiner protocol are overcollateralized, DeFiner takes advantage of existing DeFi protocols to offer its users borrowing and lending interest rates typically better than the industry average. You see DeFiner takes a portion of the collateral held in its reserves and lends it out on popular money markets like Compound or Maker to earn interest. In other words, DeFiner increases capital utilization to up to more than 85% to reduce the spread between borrowing and lending rates. </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that while this does indeed lower the spread, it comes at the cost of added composability and economic risks. Imagine a scenario where the value of a collateral asset drops quickly or a bug is found and exploited and Compound is unable to cover existing debts. This in turn may mean DeFiner could also be left with insufficient collateral unable to cover existing debts.</p>



<p>When things don’t go as planned, DeFiner allows borrowers to pay back their loans with their collateral. Triggering a self-liquidation sells your desired collateral at a 2% discount in order to cover your debt and avoid a forced liquidation, which bears a 5% collateral discount. Both discounted rates are designed to attract liquidators to participate in collateral auctions and ensure debts can reliably be covered in a timely manner.</p>



<p>DeFiner protocol uses its native token FIN to reward its most active users as well as incentivize users to help meet demand in highly sought after lending markets like USDC and DAI. DeFiner protocol releases new FIN tokens via its Proof of Premium (POP) distribution mechanism. Proof of Premium verifies the premium the prover (lenders and borrowers) generated in a specified time interval. To sum up POP, the more capital committed by a user for longer time periods and higher interest rates results in more FIN tokens being rewarded through the POP mining mechanism. FIN token holders can vote on the follow four categories: lending platform changes (i.e. loan to collateral value ratios, transaction fees, etc.), determining how platform fees are distributed, determining the distribution of FIN token rewards, and electing the board of directors for the DeFiner Organization, a non-profit entity which maintains and promotes the growth of the DeFiner lending platform and community. Currently, 100% of transaction fees and 10% of all interest generated by loans on the DeFiner protocol are distributed to FIN token holders. Learn more about FIN token and Proof of Premium <a href="https://github.com/DeFinerOrg/whitepaper/wiki/DeFiner-Whitepaper#definer-token-fin-economy">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>Decentralized finance has been a series of innovations each one building on the next. That’s why it’s nice to see DeFiner exploring ways to utilize secondary money markets to improve its own money market for the benefit of its users. DeFiner plans to release a mobile app in the future. With the ever increasing popularity of mobile banking, this feels like a natural progression of DeFiner’s mission to reduce friction for users. <a href="https://twitter.com/definerorg">Follow DeFiner on Twitter</a> to keep up with the latest updates.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This past year has been an incredible time of maturation and expansion for decentralized finance. Familiar protocols have seen increased adoption, cementing the foundation on which the whirlwind of new projects have been built. Our community has multiplied in numbers. Countless newcomers are venturing down the DeFi rabbit hole where it is easy to get lost in the numerous technological and economic terms and concepts you must learn. The whole experience can be ultimately overwhelming because not only is DeFi expanding wider, it is also getting deeper.<br><br>As DeFi grows larger with more complex and moving parts, it’s important that we have the tools necessary to safely sustain said growth. Each new user, token, feature, project, or protocol adds a variable that users need to take into account when weighing the risks of the protocols that they use. It’s difficult to say the least for users, new and old, to properly assess and compare economic risk across protocols. DeFi Pulse has long been an advocate for user safety and educating users about risk because informed users make informed decisions which results in a healthier ecosystem. And so, we’ve partnered with financial simulation experts at Gauntlet to provide a simpler way to inform users of risk: DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade.</p>



<h2><strong>DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade, as the name implies, is a 1 to 100 grade that allows users to more easily quantify and compare the economic risks of using on-chain protocols. Grades are created by running simulations utilizing data from centralized and decentralized exchanges combined with on-chain user data to estimate market risks. For a more in-depth explanation of the simulation model, we recommend you read this <a href="https://medium.com/gauntlet-networks/understanding-risk-in-defi-f64574593979">blog post from Gauntlet</a>.</p>



<p>At launch, safety grades are primarily focused on the risk of insolvency for decentralized protocols or, in other words, the risk to the depositor.  Lending protocols are a perfect starting point because they are one of the most popular DeFi applications and have many compounding variables. Gauntlet’s simulations assess four key factors: user behavior, collateral volatility, relative collateral liquidity, protocol parameters. All of these risk factors combined are practically impossible for the average user to evaluate. Our position in the community allows us to take Gauntlet’s sophisticated models and communicate them in a digestible format for a wide audience. The net result of which we hope is a safer DeFi ecosystem full of users mindful of risk.</p>



<p><strong>Safety grades are now available for </strong><a href="https://defipulse.com/aave"><strong>Aave</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href="https://defipulse.com/compound"><strong>Compound</strong></a><strong> on DeFi Pulse.</strong> In this initial alpha, these grades are formed by analyzing the historical liquidity and volatility data to find the &#8216;riskiest collateral&#8217;. Then, the risk of the system for users borrowing stablecoins against this collateral is estimated and normalized to create the 1 to 100 grade you see on DeFi Pulse. The higher the grade, the higher the economic safety the protocol.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="580" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_430-1024x580.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8587" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_430-1024x580.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_430-300x170.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_430-768x435.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_430-1536x870.jpg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_430-1568x889.jpg 1568w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Selection_430.jpg 1904w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you follow DeFi, you’ve probably noticed that the concept of yield farming is everywhere lately. From some of the most original memes in the Ethereum ecosystem to traditional news outlets like Forbes, crop rotation to maximize yield across protocols has become one of the defining activities on DeFi in 2020.</p>



<h3><strong>So, what is Yield Farming?</strong></h3>



<p>Yield farming is the act of leveraging different DeFi protocols and products to earn a yield or a return on their assets, in some cases obtaining profits well over 100% APY through a combination of lending interest and token incentives. </p>



<p>The recent yield farming frenzy made total value Locked (TVL) on DeFi skyrocket to new all-time highs, zooming far past $2B. Yield farming has had a substantial impact on protocols like Compound, Balancer, Curve, MCDEX, and Uniswap V2 just to name a few as DeFi users aim to cash in on the trend. This frenzy has brought some important questions to light. Should short term speculative usage of the Ethereum network be considered an indicator of long term adoption? Is this frenzy only a momentary activity that will lose traction once yields go down? Ultimately, is this the beginning of a new growth cycle for Ethereum?</p>



<h3><strong>How Did The Yield Farming Frenzy begin?</strong></h3>



<p>The Yield Farming frenzy started when Compound began the live distribution of COMP, its governance token, on June 14th. Compound reached more than $600M total value locked, and overtook MakerDAO for the first time ever on DeFi Pulse’s leaderboard, making it the #1 protocol in DeFi by this measure in a matter of days. However, COMP appears to have only been the beginning with Balancer having launched their protocol rewards incentive program in May started their live distribution a few days after Compound. Balancer experienced similar exponential growth, adding more than $70M TVL.</p>



<p>Although the frenzy started with COMP, yield farming has been known and practiced in DeFi for some time now. Synthetix, for example, had introduced the concept of protocol token rewards in exchange for liquidity provision to the sETH/ETH pool on Uniswap V1 in July 2019.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today marks the end of an era. Right as yield farming is taking off we just finalised a poll on SCCP-29 <a href="https://t.co/bXU07AjQsd">https://t.co/bXU07AjQsd</a>. This was the original yield farming pool for sETH:ETH on Uniswap V1. So as it winds down, let&#39;s take a little trip down memory lane.</p>&mdash; kain.eth (@kaiynne) <a href="https://twitter.com/kaiynne/status/1276417760222797825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 26, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Things really started taking off a few hours after COMP began being distributed and users started heavily investing in the USDT market on Compound, the one paying the highest amount of COMP rewards. COMP is distributed on a 50%-50% basis between suppliers and borrowers of a given market, and total rewards are allocated in a proportional way to each market’s yield returns. One of the many strategies that were applied was taking out USDT loans with DAI as collateral and investing them in the corresponding market on Compound. Next, BAT became the most profitable market for COMP farming. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just went short on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24USDT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$USDT</a> using <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DAI&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$DAI</a> as collateral on <a href="https://t.co/cnckUC54V0">https://t.co/cnckUC54V0</a> using maximum <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24COMP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$COMP</a> mining recipe.<br><br>Looks like I&#39;m earning way more than I&#39;m paying interest with the current <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24COMP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$COMP</a> price hovering around ~$60.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/YOLO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#YOLO</a> <a href="https://t.co/03YGZm0Jui">pic.twitter.com/03YGZm0Jui</a></p>&mdash; Samyak Jain (@smykjain) <a href="https://twitter.com/smykjain/status/1272634332599824390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Compound’s team proposed to update the system’s liquidity incentive one week after COMP distribution went live on June 27th. The proposal looked to discourage an inorganic demand for BAT and other assets since users were concentrating extreme liquidation risks into these markets. The new liquidity incentive proposal was executed on July 2nd. Currently, COMP is distributed proportionally across the markets that borrow more dollars, and not dollars of interest paid. Rewards continue to be distributed on a 50%-50% basis between suppliers and borrowers of a given market. You can read more about <a href="https://compound.comradery.io/post/1762">Compound’s proposal to update the system’s liquidity incentives here.<br><br></a>The liquidity incentive effectively discouraged farmers from leveraging markets such as BAT. And now, yield farmers have ballooned the Compound DAI markets to levels higher than the total DAI in existence.  You can check out <a href="https://compound.finance/markets">the current Compound markets here</a> and <a href="https://compound.finance/governance/comp">COMP distribution here</a>.</p>



<p>Balancer began its live distribution of BAL on June 23rd, which caused a spike of more than $50M in TVL in a few days. You likely recall our previous DeFi Pulse Drop with <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/balancer-start-liquidity-mining-and-earn-bal-tokens-today/">Balancer Labs announcing their liquidity incentive program, which allows users to earn BAL on top of pool swap fees</a>. Seventy-five million BAL tokens (75% of fully diluted supply) will be distributed among liquidity providers on a 145K weekly basis.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Is this the beginning of a new growth cycle for DeFi?</strong></h3>



<p>The current Yield Farming frenzy has some resemblances with the ICO frenzy of 2017, in which billions of dollars were invested across many tokens, which ultimately proved to be worthless.<strong> One of the main differences with today’s Governance Tokens is that these are being issued by protocols that <em>already have running products that provide value to the ecosystem</em>, instead of being outright scams.</strong> Even though it’s probable that today’s high yields will face a market correction and be lowered at some point, the current frenzy might still continue for some time. And as we have learned in the past, adoption increases after each frenzy: more users and developers are driven to the ecosystem, and the allocated capital funds the development of new innovations that are later used by a broader ecosystem.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The fragmentation of the stablecoin market in DeFi has led to a lackluster experience for many crypto users. Gone are the days when DeFi was DAI-centric; nowadays, most DeFi users find themselves having to shuffle between a handful of stablecoins in order to take advantage of the opportunities available in DeFi. </p>



<p>And if you aren&#8217;t trying to hack your yield, you&#8217;re missing out by today&#8217;s standards. The whole process can be a lot to take in for even experienced users; imagine being a new user trying to determine the best stablecoin to own <em>and </em>earn the best yield. On its face, it&#8217;s not a simple problem to solve and sometimes users are forced to make compromises. At least until now&#8230; One of the best qualities of DeFi is that there&#8217;s always someone tackling new problems as they arise. That&#8217;s where mStable comes in with meta-assets like mUSD.</p>



<h2>mStable&#8217;s mUSD is tokenized USD made simpler, safer, and more efficient</h2>



<p>mStable&#8217;s mUSD addresses both the fragmentation of USD-pegged stablecoins and the lack of native yield by uniting stablecoin swapping and lending. And, it does so while also offering protection against complete capital loss (more on that in a bit). mUSD is a USD-pegged token backed by a basket of popular stablecoins with built-in yield generated from mStable SWAP fees and lending collateral on Compound and Aave. To be more precise, mStable assets like mUSD are actually a LP share in a dynamic pool of assets that generates yield, offers 0 slippage swaps between its underlying assets, and serves as a first class asset. I know that&#8217;s a bit of a mouthful. So let&#8217;s take a look at mUSD, which is <a href="https://medium.com/mstable/mstable-now-live-on-mainnet-c9f55f748ac7">live on the mainnet</a>, as an example.</p>



<p>When you first open <a href="https://app.mstable.org/">the app</a>, you&#8217;re greeted with mStable&#8217;s sleek interface containing a few quick slides that break down mUSD&#8217;s three main functions: <strong>MINT</strong>, <strong>SAVE</strong>, and <strong>SWAP</strong>.</p>



<h3>MINT</h3>



<p>Anyone can <a href="https://app.mstable.org/mint">mint new mUSD</a> by depositing a 1:1 ratio of USDT, USDC, TUSD or DAI into mStable. For example, if you send 1000 USDT, you&#8217;ll receive 1000 mUSD. You can also conveniently &#8220;multi-mint&#8221; mUSD sending multiple stablecoins at the same time. On the flip side, you can redeem mUSD 1:1 for any of the underlying assets under normal conditions.</p>



<p>An important aspect of mStable&#8217;s design is the maximum weights set for assets in each basket. This limit prevents a basket from becoming unbalanced with too much of one asset. When an asset reaches its max weight, it changes how users can mint, swap, or redeem mStable assets like mUSD.</p>



<p>Say mUSD is overweighted towards USDT, users are unable to mint mUSD with USDT, only TUSD, DAI, and USDC. Whereas if you&#8217;re looking to redeem mUSD, you would only be able to multi-redeem into an equivalent combination of assets according to the basket&#8217;s current weight or straight 1:1 for USDT. These limits keep mUSD on peg and act as a safety measure to keep mUSD collateralized in the unfortunate event one of the underlying assets&#8217; value falls below its peg. You can find current mUSD basket analytics <a href="https://app.mstable.org/analytics">here</a>.</p>



<p>mStable&#8217;s <a href="https://docs.mstable.org/mstable-assets/functions/governance">governance system</a> and Meta (MTA) token are designed to reduce the risks for mUSD holders. If an underlying asset completely loses its value causing mUSD to fall off its peg, mStable&#8217;s Meta Governors as they are called can vote to purge the asset and recover the lost value using by selling staked MTA token for the outstanding mUSD. This mUSD is then burned until the system is re-collateralized. MTA token holders stake their MTA essentially acting as insurance against loss to receive a portion of all revenue that mStable generates.</p>



<p>mUSD&#8217;s design affords DeFi users convenient access to its underlying stablecoins while offering a hedge against their individual risks and enhance their functionality with features such as native yield. Another handy aspect of mUSD is that the yield it generates through SAVE actually mints new mUSD meaning it&#8217;s always priced 1:1 to the USD by design.</p>



<h3>SAVE</h3>



<p>Once you&#8217;ve minted some mUSD, you can <a href="https://app.mstable.org/save">deposit your mUSD into SAVE and start earning</a>. All mStable asset holders can earn a native yield generated from mStable SWAP fees combined with interest accrued from lending out the underlying assets to decentralized lending markets like Compound and AAVE. A portion of this yield is allocated to Meta (MTA) holders as reward for governing and insuring mStable. At the time of writing, the average daily APY over the past 7 days on mUSD&#8217;s SAVE contract is over 23%. Obviously, this rate is subject to change as lending market rates and trading volumes vary.</p>



<p>mStable&#8217;s SAVE contract takes chasing interest rates between stablecoins and lending markets which is practically a full-time job at this point and makes it simple for users just looking to hold and earn value as tokenized USD. SAVE currently supports lending on Compound and AAVE but Meta Governors will have the ability to add or remove lending platforms through mStable governance. When you combine this with the fees generated from mStable zero-slippage SWAP fees and single asset mUSD redemptions, mUSD&#8217;s advantages over holding any individual stablecoin start to add up.</p>



<h3>SWAP</h3>



<p>Anyone can use <a href="https://app.mstable.org/swap">mStable SWAP</a> to swap TUSD, DAI, USDC, and USDT with zero-slippage and a fixed BPS fee. Zero-slippage swaps are made possible by a combination of mStable&#8217;s straight line <a href="https://medium.com/mstable/introducing-constant-sum-bonding-curves-for-tokenised-assets-6e18879cdc5b">constant sum bonding curves</a> and the insurance MTA tokens provide to the system. This also enables SWAP to scale from day 1 because prices are not dependent on the amount of liquidity in the pool.</p>



<p>As with minting, swaps that would push an asset over its max weight are paused, altering swap rules for only this asset until the basket is rebalanced. And as previously mentioned, users with mUSD in SAVE earn the fees generated from SWAP. Although, a portion of these fees are rewarded to those staking MTA.</p>



<h2>Meta (MTA) token and mStable governance</h2>



<p>mStable&#8217;s core team controls the mStable protocol at launch; However, the plan is to distribute Meta (MTA) tokens and gradually turn mStable governance systems over to the community of Meta Governors. MTA reward programs will be used to bootstrap the mStable ecosystem rewarding early adopters. Although MTA doesn&#8217;t exist yet, you can actually take part in ecosystem rewards and earn MTA early right now (more details in the section below).</p>



<p>To participate in governance and earn their allotted share of mStable revenue, users must stake their MTA tokens. Staking rewards act as an incentive for Meta Governors to properly maintain the growth and stability of mStable. Meta Governors may propose and vote on protocol changes such as:</p>



<ul><li>Add or remove mStable assets</li><li>Add or remove basket assets</li><li>Adjust the max weights of basket assets</li><li>Change SWAP fees</li><li>Change MTA staking rewards / revenue take</li></ul>



<h4>Meta (MTA) Distribution</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="963" height="591" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mta-dist.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8358" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mta-dist.png 963w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mta-dist-300x184.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mta-dist-768x471.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 963px) 100vw, 963px" /></figure>



<ul><li><strong>Current Investors:&nbsp;</strong>6.5%</li><li><strong>Reserved for future sales &amp; growth:</strong>&nbsp;26.0%</li><li><strong>Reserved for Public Rewards:&nbsp;</strong>20.0%</li><li><strong>Reserved for Institutional Rewards:&nbsp;</strong>5.0%</li><li><strong>Rewards yet to be allocated:&nbsp;</strong>20.0%</li><li><strong>Team, Advisors &amp; Future Team:&nbsp;</strong>22.5%</li></ul>



<h3>Ecosystem rewards</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/mta-rewards-1024x479.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8362"/></figure>



<p>20,000,000 MTA in total, or rather 20% of MTA’s total supply, will be emitted via ecosystem rewards over the next 5 years to bootstrap mStable and promote a fairer, wider distribution of Meta tokens. Rewards encourage users to mint mStable assets and to create liquidity and utility with those assets.</p>



<p>Ecosystem Rewards began June 26th, 2020 with the launch of mStable&#8217;s first reward pool on Balancer creating liquidity for mUSD&lt;&gt;USDC. Ecosystem rewards will continue in monthly tranches, increasing over the first 15 months, and then slowly decline until the allocated MTA is exhausted.</p>



<h4>Earn MTA via Balancer pools</h4>



<p>mStable&#8217;s<a href="https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x72Cd8f4504941Bf8c5a21d1Fd83A96499FD71d2C"> first MTA reward pool</a> is a Balancer pool weighted 50% mUSD / 50% USDC with a 5 bps trading fee. Anyone can mint mUSD and deposit equal parts mUSD and USDC into the pool and start earning MTA on top of the usual BAL token rewards and potential Balancer pool profits. The <a href="https://medium.com/mstable/mstables-second-mta-reward-pool-is-now-live-af22ad151b47">second MTA reward pool</a> is another Balancer pool with similar weights and fees; however this pool is mUSD/WETH.</p>



<p>350,000 MTA will be awarded to pool liquidity providers over the first month. Each week, a snapshot will be taken at a random time and 50,000 MTA will be allocated to the participating addresses in proportion to their contribution to their respective pools.</p>



<h3>MTA token launch</h3>



<p>mStable is set to launch Meta (MTA) on Balancer at approximately 14:00 UTC on Wednesday, July 15th 2020. At that time, 2,666,666 MTA tokens and ~$400,000 mUSD will be deposited into a new Balancer liquidity pool. The initial liquidity pool price will effectively be set to $0.15 mUSD/MTA. <a href="https://medium.com/mstable/introducing-meta-mta-mstables-protocol-token-6e1032291ccf">Read more</a>. <em>** Since publication, <a href="https://twitter.com/mstable_/status/1283264646405746688">the launch has been delayed</a>.</em></p>



<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>



<p>As someone who has been around for a while, I&#8217;ve seen a lot and I can say that mStable&#8217;s mUSD is an elegant solution to the current issues stablecoin holders face. The purpose of stablecoins is to act as a useful and stable store of value; mUSD takes this to the next level by extending the functionality of existing stablecoins while also mitigating risk for holders. </p>



<p>I&#8217;m excited to see the future of mStable protocol with assets like mBTC, mGBP, mEUR, and mGLD. Not to mention, there are so many opportunities for Meta Governors to expand the utility of mAssets by integrating new lending protocols and DeFi services.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-road-815297_1280-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8061" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-road-815297_1280-1024x682.jpg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-road-815297_1280-300x200.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-road-815297_1280-768x512.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/the-road-815297_1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>



<p>On Thursday March 12, 2020, the price of Ether (ETH) dropped over 30% in about 24 hours. The result sent chain reaction rippling through DeFi in an event many will likely come to refer to as Black Thursday. DeFi users rushed to make transactions like trading on DEXes, paying off debts, bolstering collateral ratio, etc. The increased activity led to record-setting high gas prices at times exceeding 200 gwei. </p>



<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with how gas prices work, think of it as an auction for the limited space in each block. Users desperate to get their transaction through start to outbid each other to get their transactions completed in a timely manner. And then, the ensuing &#8220;bidding wars&#8221; drive up gas prices and subsequently cause low-priced transactions to be stuck until things settle down. <strong><em>The bottom line is that the increased volume put a lot of stress on DeFi smart contracts along with the entire Ethereum network.</em> </strong>So we&#8217;ve decided to put together this status update to provide context for those unaware who may panic at the sight of the charts lately.</p>



<h4>Don&#8217;t panic. All is not lost and DeFi endured the test.</h4>



<p>I think it&#8217;s worth taking a moment to say: <em>there are safety measures in place for a reason.</em> When you install fire alarms and safety systems you hope you never need to use them, but know that there could always come a day when you have to. And if your home catches on fire, you don&#8217;t abandon the concept of living in homes altogether. You rebuild your home and this time you build it bit safer and better overall. We, as a community, have been tested before and have only grown stronger for these trials. A decentralized financial market is a market worth fighting for and the truth is&#8230; DeFi remains one of the most exciting and innovative spaces on this planet and will only continue to grow and evolve despite the occasional bump in the road.</p>



<p><em>High levels of network congestion affected the entire Ethereum network so we&#8217;ll only be addressing some of the more notable ways DeFi projects were affected by recent events.</em></p>



<h2>Maker</h2>



<p>While the exact issue is still <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/recent-market-activity-and-next-steps/">under investigation</a>, the dramatic increase in gas prices caused Maker&#8217;s price feed oracle to remain stuck at ~$166 despite the market dipping almost 15% lower at times. High gas prices also affected Keeper bots, preventing many from liquidating undercollateralized loans. Unfortunately, some Keepers were able to bid on and purchase collateral ETH for 0 DAI. And, many Vault owners reported 100% of their collateral being liquidated. </p>



<p>A Maker community call was held to determine the best plan of action. Maker put out <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/recent-market-activity-and-next-steps/">a blog post</a> addressing the situation and proposed various parameters which could be adjusted to prevent further issues. MKR holders have since <a href="https://vote.makerdao.com/executive-proposal/adjust-multiple-risk-parameters">approved changes</a> including lowering debt ceilings, lowering stability fees, changing auction parameters to allow keepers additional time and limit the total number of auctions.</p>



<p>Among the approved parameter changes was delaying the Debt Auction, designed to cover the +$4M in remaining system debt, in an attempt to give the community more time to prepare.</p>



<h3>MKR Debt Auction</h3>



<p>Maker is designed with a pool of DAI called the <em>Maker Buffer</em> reserved to cover debts in situations like this<em>.</em> However, the Maker Buffer was unable to cover the deficit caused by the tremendous amount of liquidations. As stated in its <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/">whitepaper</a>, the Maker Protocol will now trigger a Debt Auction where MKR is minted and sold for DAI to re-collateralize the system. </p>



<p><strong>Here are the details for the auction according to<a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/mkr-debt-auction-announcement-and-details/"> MakerDAO&#8217;s blog</a>: </strong></p>



<ul><li>Start time: March 19, 6:25 am ET (March 19, 10:25 am UTC)</li><li> MKR will be auctioned off in lots for 50,000 Dai</li><li>According to parameters of the Maker Protocol as determined by governance, the auction works as in the following example:<ul><li>The protocol offers a Keeper (bidder) a lot of 250 MKR for 50,000 Dai, which translates to a price of 200 Dai/MKR. </li><li>A second keeper bids 50,000 Dai but only requires 230 MKR, which translates to a price of 217 Dai/MKR. </li><li>The bid prices increase through the Keepers’ willingness to take slightly less MKR in exchange for 50,000 Dai. </li></ul></li><li>If no one bids on the first lot of 250 MKR, then the auction can be re-initialized after three days, offering 20% more MKR (300 MKR) for 50,000 Dai, which translates to a price of 166.66 Dai/MKR.</li><li>Finally, if there is at least one bid, and no one outbids it within 6 hours, the auction ends.</li></ul>



<p>Anyone is free to participate in the auction by running an Auction Keeper. Maker provides <a href="https://blog.makerdao.com/how-to-run-your-own-auction-keeper-bot-in-mcd/">documentation on how to run an auction keeper bot</a> but no official front-end UI. However, there are some in the community working on making these systems more accessible for the auction.</p>



<h3>Dai Backstop Syndicate</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignleft size-large"><a href="https://t.me/backstopsyndicate"><img loading="lazy" width="320" height="320" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/backstopsyndicate.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-8034" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/backstopsyndicate.jpg 320w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/backstopsyndicate-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/backstopsyndicate-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /></a></figure></div>



<p>We&#8217;re working with Dharma and many other community members to organize a community-led effort dubbed the <strong><a href="https://t.me/backstopsyndicate">DAI Backstop Syndicate</a></strong> to form a backstop in support of MKR and act as a buyer of last resort in the upcoming MKR auction.</p>



<p>The idea is to create pool contract that would give syndicate participants a way to participate in the auction process should MKR fall below a given price like 100 DAI / MKR.  The intention is to be a backstop, not necessarily buy the MKR nor will it provide liquidity for liquidations during Dai Surplus Auctions (flaps).</p>



<p>The contract will be designed so anyone could trigger an auction using pooled funds at the given price once auctions begin. At which point, all participants would be able to redeem the tokens they minted by supplying Dai for the equiv. Dai / MKR blend held by the pool.</p>



<p><strong><em>If you&#8217;re interested in participating, <a href="https://t.me/backstopsyndicate">join the telegram</a> to help organize, review<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1miS-snhSYBKwjQHM1MOPnLZZl9i2gj3zTcvuQWecV2M/edit#"> the proposal</a> and <a href="https://github.com/backstop-syndicate/dai-backstop-syndicate">Github repo</a> for full details</em></strong>.</p>



<h3>Nexus Mutual claims</h3>



<p>As of writing this, 3 out of the 11 <a href="https://nexustracker.io/claims">submitted claims</a> related to the MakerDAO incident have been denied by Nexus Mutual. Those with Nexus Mutual cover on MakerDAO have been <a href="https://twitter.com/NexusMutual/status/1238496725054230534">instructed to wait</a> for more complete information before submitting new claims.</p>



<h2>Compound</h2>



<p>Compound placed in its timelock three precautionary changes to how its protocol handles DAI in the case it becomes unpegged and mass liquidations are required.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Three changes have been queued in the Compound protocol timelock, as a precaution due to recent volatility:<br><br>A new price feed that allows DAI to become unpegged in a MakerDAO emergency shutdown;<br>Liquidation incentive 5% -&gt; 8% -&gt; 15%<br><br>These will only be activated if necessary.</p>&mdash; Compound Labs (@compoundfinance) <a href="https://twitter.com/compoundfinance/status/1238308271963828226?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<h2>Synthetix</h2>



<p>The high network congestion forced Synthetix to go down for short period of time as its rates provided by on-chain Chainlink oracles to go stale. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="629" height="415" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Selection_999064.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8028" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Selection_999064.png 629w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Selection_999064-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></figure>



<p>After some time, the system was brought back online and the Synthetix team released <a href="https://github.com/Synthetixio/SIPs/blob/master/SCCP/sccp-16.md">SCCP-16</a> which temporarily increased fee reclamation waiting period to an hour to accommodate extreme network congestion. This change was reverted after the congestion subsided.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="629" height="228" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Selection_999065.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8045" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Selection_999065.png 629w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Selection_999065-300x109.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 629px) 100vw, 629px" /></figure>



<h2>Aave</h2>



<p>Aave protocol also took measures to reduce the impact of MKR and DAI instability.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<h2>dYdX</h2>



<p>Combating high gas costs, dYdX progressively increased its minimum trade size throughout the day on March 12. The first step was up to 10 ETH or 2000 DAI, it was ultimately raised as high as 40 ETH or 5000 DAI. By the evening of March 13, the min. trade size was restored back to normal (0.1 ETH or 20 DAI).</p>



<h2>DDEX</h2>



<p>DDEX incurred minor losses of $5373 which will be covered by its built-in insurance.</p>

<h2>Green on the board</h2>



<p>The silver lining of the day was that many smart contracts like Uniswap functioned performed as expected under the massive stress placed on the Ethereum network. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yesterday during all the insanity Uniswap 24hr volume reached $53M<br><br>I don’t feel like celebrating but I’m glad it was able to handle the massively increased load without issue. <br><br>A major testament to Ethereum imo<br><br>Was this the highest volume day of any DEX ever? <a href="https://t.co/cv4x3m8Zyu">pic.twitter.com/cv4x3m8Zyu</a></p>&mdash; Hayden Adams <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f984.png" alt="🦄" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> (@haydenzadams) <a href="https://twitter.com/haydenzadams/status/1238457224214786048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 13, 2020</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p><strong>Examining our DeFi rankings during these events, it was clear DEXes like Uniswap, DeFi lenders [like dYdX, Nuo, Robo-Advisor for Yield (RAY), and Dharma], and payment networks like xDai and Connext fared the best.</strong> All of which are DeFi smart contracts generally less impacted by price fluctuations and high gas prices with more diverse collateral options and/or lower risk yields.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Stress tests like these help expose cracks in DeFi smart contracts that can be repaired and improved upon. They also serve as important reminders to do your own research and plan accordingly for potential smart contract risks. DeFi is still a very young market and bumps in the road are to be expected. And when things get rough, remember what brought us here together as a community: the exciting prospect of a decentralized financial system open to all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Introducing <a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">Interest Per Year</a>, or IPY for short, a new metric created by DeFi Pulse used to track the performance of DeFi lending markets.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine IPY like the speedometer for DeFi measuring the speed at which interest is accruing in DeFi lending protocols given the borrow rate and outstanding debt at that moment. IPY is useful for measuring the potential performance changes of lending protocols in the short term.</span></p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s truly fascinating about a metric like IPY is the fact that it isn&#8217;t possible without DeFi.</strong> In centralized finance, banks, financial institutions, and regulators control the flow of information. These authorities choose what information gets disclosed to the public. It&#8217;s not like you can walk into your bank and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m here to perform an audit.&#8221; But things are different with DeFi.</p>
<p>With DeFi, all the data is publicly available on-chain for everyone to see. Transparency and real time data are two major&nbsp;advantages DeFi has gained by rebuilding things from scratch. And it&#8217;s up to us as members of the DeFi community to decide how we want to synthesize the data and utilize those advantages.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7742 size-full" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1.jpg" alt="" width="895" height="645" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1.jpg 895w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1-300x216.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_323-1-768x553.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 895px) 100vw, 895px" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember that DeFi lending is still maturing. Historically, the most popular form of collateral has been ETH. And, the most popular asset to borrow has been DAI. Lending rates have been highly correlated to the performance of this trading pair ETH/DAI. While rates may go up and down, outstanding debts have consistently risen over time. Additionally, as DeFi lending matures and new assets like securities, property, real estate, etc enter the picture, metrics like IPY will mature as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7745 size-full" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="815" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326.jpg 900w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326-300x272.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_326-768x695.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" /></a></p>
<p>Interest Per Year is an example of what&#8217;s possible through DeFi. It&#8217;s a metric that can help market participants better understand the condition of DeFi lending markets.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, DAI&#8217;s IPY is generally greater than USDC&#8217;s but USDC has a more stable IPY. This indicates that there is greater demand for DAI loans overall but USDC is carving out a niche for steady consistent lending returns.</span></p>
<p>Whether you want to analyze historical rates or simply stay ahead of trends in DeFi, the new&nbsp;<a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">DeFi Lending</a>&nbsp;page makes it easier to spot patterns emerging in the market.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our new page supports a variety of assets including DAI, USDC, ETH, REP, ZRX, WBTC, and BAT with lending data from Compound, Maker, dYdX, and Fulcrum.</span></p>
<h3>Witness the growth of DeFi lending markets firsthand</h3>
<p>Decentralized Finance is still in its infancy. It&#8217;s a historic time for the industry and we&#8217;re about to witness events which will shape DeFi forever. In the days ahead, we&#8217;ll see more and more assets be introduced as collateral in DeFi. Not to mention, different lending models will emerge. And on top of it all, more and more people will experience borrowing or lending in DeFi for the first time. We hope <a href="https://defipulse.com/defi-lending">DeFi Lending</a> will give you the tools to capture history in the making.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is changing the way people interact with their money.  However, we know it can be a lot to take in. Don&#8217;t worry, because we&#8217;ve put together this quick guide to give you jump start.</p>
<h2>Start making money on DeFi in 4 steps</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with Ethereum, these steps will only take a few minutes. And when it&#8217;s all said and done, you&#8217;ll be earning interest in DAI every block. <em><strong>However if you&#8217;re completely new to Ethereum,</strong></em> you may instead want to check out <strong><a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/zero-to-defi-cdai/">Zero to DeFi</a></strong>, a beginner&#8217;s guide which breaks down the entire process of getting a wallet, acquiring ETH, and lending out your DAI.</p>
<h3>1. Get ETH into an address that you own</h3>
<p>As the saying goes, if you don&#8217;t hold the private keys to the wallet, then they aren&#8217;t your coins. So, be sure to perform these steps from a wallet that you hold the private keys to. And, don&#8217;t forget to keep them backed up somewhere safe.</p>
<h3>2. Head to <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> and sell most of that ETH for DAI</h3>
<p><a href="http://DEX.AG/">DEX.AG</a> is a decentralized exchange or DEX aggregator that gets you the best price available from several of the most popular DEXes. It even splits your trade across multiple DEXes if it improves the price, all in one transaction. <strong>Make sure to leave a little ETH leftover for <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/what-is-gas/">gas fees</a>.</strong></p>
<h3><a href="https://dex.ag/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7722" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300.jpg 1000w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></h3>
<h3>3. Go to DeFi Pulse&#8217;s <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">Earn Income page</a></h3>
<p>DeFi Pulse is a site where you can find the latest analytics and rankings of DeFi protocols. The DeFi Pulse <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">Earn Income page</a> compares the interest rates you can earn from DeFi lending protocols.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/income"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7715" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-260x300.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="693" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-260x300.jpg 260w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-886x1024.jpg 886w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-768x887.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295.jpg 934w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h3>4. Pick a lending protocol, and start earning interest</h3>
<p>Enter the asset and amount you wish to lend to find which lending protocol has the best interest rate. Pick a protocol and click the &#8216;Next&#8217; button which will redirect you to that app/service. Compound finance is currently the most popular lending protocol. Follow the app&#8217;s instructions to begin lending out your DAI and start earning interest.</p>
<h3>And then later, when you&#8217;re ready to cash out&#8230;</h3>
<p>Head back to the lending protocol you chose and use your private key to unlock the DAI plus interest generated whenever you want. There&#8217;s no &#8220;lock-in&#8221; period or time you have to wait before earning interest. Your DAI is earning interest every block until you choose to stop.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you keep hearing about Ethereum and DeFi from a co-worker, family member, or friend and want to learn more. It&#8217;s no wonder everyone is talking about DeFi, or rather decentralized finance, when it&#8217;s the fastest growing sector of finance. DeFi applications built on the Ethereum blockchain currently in control of $500 million worth of digital assets. And on top of that, users have historically earned 5-20% interest in DeFi lending platforms. But we&#8217;re getting ahead of ourselves&#8230;</p>
<p>With so much information out there, it can be hard to make heads or tails of where to begin. So we&#8217;ve put together this guide to help you along as you take your first steps into the exciting new world of Ethereum and decentralized finance, aka DeFi. And by the end of this guide, you&#8217;ll be able to see your money grow every few seconds with a yearly interest higher than any bank will ever offer you. So let&#8217;s get started putting your money to work for you.</p>
<h1>Getting started</h1>
<h4>What is cryptocurrency?</h4>
<p>Cryptocurrency is a new form of digital asset created, maintained, and secured by a decentralized network of participants. A type of distributed ledger called a  blockchain is most commonly used to securely store and distribute cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>A blockchain is a system for maintaining a shared ledger among a network of computers around the world called nodes. The ledger stores the entire history of a cryptocurrency and every transaction that has occurred in its history. Each node keeps a copy of the ledger to verify account balances and transactions for themselves.</p>
<p>Transactions on the blockchain are processed by miners. Miners take pending transactions submitted to the network and organize them into a small blocks of data. These blocks of transactions form a chain as new ones are added thus the name blockchain.</p>
<p>Miners compete for which block should be appended to the chain by solving a math puzzles in a process called mining. The miner who solves a block first gets to collect all the transaction fees paid within that block and is given issued newly minted cryptocurrency as a reward. This reward is called a block reward.</p>
<p>Mining distributes new cryptocurrency as well as secures the network. Mining requires a lot of energy and resources. <span style="font-weight: 400;">This creates an incentive for miners to continue producing blocks in an honest manner. Due to the fact each block is created based on the previous one, it becomes more and more difficult for someone to try and trick the rest of the network. </span>This concept of using computational power and incentives to secure the network is called Proof of Work.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If an attacker wanted to change the history stored in the blockchain, they would need to have a majority of the total mining power or hashrate of a cryptocurrency network. In other words, a network remains secure as long as no one miner controls 51% of the mining power, also known as a 51% attack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even if they did, maintaining this type of attack quickly becomes infeasible due to its costs. The idea is that the reward for mining valid blocks outweighs what a bad actor stands to gain by performing a 51% attack. </span></p>
<h4>What is a wallet?</h4>
<p>A wallet is a software application used to send and store cryptocurrency as well as interact with any applications built on that blockchain.</p>
<p>A wallet can be roughly compared to your bank account; it stores your assets and it has an &#8220;account number&#8221; or address. Some wallets allow you to generate multiple public addresses. Only your assets are store securely on the blockchain instead of in the custody of your bank.</p>
<p>Wallets have no registration or sign-up process. There are two parts to generating and accessing your wallet. Wallets are generated with a 12 or 24 word phrase called your seed words. Other common names are seed phrase, recovery phrase, and mnemonic phrase. With this phrase, you can recover or restore your wallet from anywhere.</p>
<p>When you generate your wallet, you&#8217;ll be asked to set a password or pin which is required to login in or access your wallet. Do not forget this password otherwise you will be locked out of your wallet. And, the only way to &#8220;reset&#8221; the password is to recover the wallet again with your seed phrase.</p>
<h4>Why is my seed phrase so important?</h4>
<p>As previously mentioned, your seed phrase is what you use to restore your wallet. In the case where your wallet is inaccessible, lost, or destroyed, you&#8217;ll need this phrase to recover your wallet and the cryptocurrency it holds.</p>
<p>If you lose your seed phrase and no longer can access your wallet, your funds could potentially be lost forever. This is why backing up your seed phrase is so important.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also important to keep in mind that <em>anyone</em> with your seed phrase can recover your wallets and take the funds inside. So be very careful where you store them and who may have access to them. Many people store their seed phrase in their safe or a safety deposit box. Don&#8217;t store them in a Google Doc where almost anyone can stumble on them.</p>
<h4>How do I keep my cryptocurrency safe from hack or theft?</h4>
<p>Generally, to keep yourself safe from hackers or thieves online you&#8217;ll need to follow best practices when it comes to cybersecurity and privacy. Things like keeping your PC clear of viruses or malware, using secure passwords (maybe even a password manager), securing your network properly, enable app-based 2FA like Authy or Google Authenticator wherever possible, etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot cover all of cybersecurity in this guide because it is far too vast of a topic. However, here&#8217;s some resources that can help you learn the best practices for keeping yourself safe online and offline.</p>

<h4>What is Ethereum? What is ether (ETH)?</h4>
<p>Ethereum is the world’s leading programmable blockchain. Ether (ETH) is the Ethereum network&#8217;s native cryptocurrency. All transactions on the Ethereum network require transaction fees paid in ETH called gas.</p>
<h4>What is a smart contract? What are tokens?</h4>
<p>Smart contracts are what make ETH programmable money. Smart contracts are  applications or scripts programmed to run on the Ethereum network capable of creating and managing digital assets. You can build complex irreversible agreements without the need for a middle man.</p>
<p>These applications are called DApps, or decentralized applications. Smart contracts have many use cases including financial products (borrowing, lending, trading, payments), games, collectibles, and much much more.</p>
<p>Smart contracts allow you to create digital assets called tokens. Tokens represent many types of digital assets such as currencies, tokenized physical assets like gold, a share of ownership in a DApp, etc.</p>
<h4>What is DeFi?</h4>
<p>Decentralized finance, or DeFi for short, is what the Ethereum community calls financial smart contracts, decentralized applications (DApps), and protocols built on Ethereum. Popular DeFi products include decentralized exchanges, lending and borrowing markets, tokenized physical assets such as gold, derivatives, prediction / betting markets, payment networks, insurance, etc.</p>
<h4><b>What is a decentralized exchange?</b></h4>
<p>A decentralized exchange, or DEX for short, is like a stock exchange run by a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Although both allow you to trade assets, a decentralized exchange trades cryptocurrency only and so does not require a centralized authority to operate.</p>
<p>DEXes are perfect for trading ETH or tokens on the blockchain without having to rely on a centralized authority like a traditional cryptocurrency exchange. Trading on a DEX reduces some risk because you keep your ETH and tokens in your wallet instead of placing them in someone else&#8217;s control. Trades are made by transacting with the DEX&#8217;s underlying smart contract and the only time your funds leave your account is to execute a trade.</p>
<h4><b><img loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-7587 alignnone" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/maker-logo-1024x288.jpeg" alt="" width="640" height="180" /></b></h4>
<h4><b>What is DAI and MakerDAO?</b></h4>
<p>MakerDAO is a smart contract that let&#8217;s users open Collateralized Debt Positions, or CDPs for short. Users deposit ETH as collateral and are able to mint/borrow a token called DAI. DAI is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.</p>
<p>Borrowers pay an annual interest rate called the stability fee for the opportunity to mint new DAI. And when the debt is repaid, the DAI is burned along with the stability fee owed in Maker&#8217;s token MKR. The stability fee deters users from over-inflating the total supply of DAI.</p>
<p>CDP holders are required to have a minimum of 150% collateral to outstanding debt. For every 1 DAI, there is at least $1.50 worth of Ether (ETH) locked into a Maker CDP as collateral. And if their collateral value falls, the CDP holder must lock in more ETH, pay back some of their debt, or risk having their position liquidated. When a CDP is liquidated, the ETH held as collateral is automatically sold to pay back the debts in addition to penalty fee for falling before a ratio of 150%.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, Maker has its own token called MKR which is used to pay for the stability fee on outstanding debts. Maker (MKR)&#8217;s primary function is to act as a voting share in the MakerDAO system. MKR holders vote on changes and issues that affect how Maker&#8217;s underlying smart contract operates. As MKR burns with each debt repaid, the idea is that MKR&#8217;s value will increase if it is governed well.</p>
<p>MakerDAO is sort of like a central bank in the sense it issues DAI in charge of keeping DAI stable at ~$1. If the DAI supply increases too much and DAI&#8217;s value falls below $1, the stability fee is increased to encourage CDP holders to pay back their debts.</p>
<p>Here is where it is important for us to mention that you don&#8217;t have to open a CDP to own DAI. You can simply purchase DAI off of the open market from someone else who opened a CDP. Whoever you bought the DAI from still owes the debt and their collateral remains locked in MakerDAO until the debt is paid. It&#8217;s a lot like how the US dollar used to be back by gold.</p>
<p>DAI is like a smart version of the US Dollar. While the price of ETH may fluctuate, you can count on DAI to hover around $1. So there&#8217;s a natural demand for DAI because its programability combined with its stability makes it perfect for payments, commerce, games, loans, and many many more use cases and DApps.</p>

<p><b>What is Compound? What is cDAI? Why am I earning interest?</b></p>
<p>Compound is a smart contract that allows users to borrow and lend tokens. Similar to your bank, Compound lends out your money to borrowers and earn interest over time. But unlike your bank, your interest begins compounding the minute you deposit into Compound&#8217;s smart contract. And since it&#8217;s a smart contract, the rate you earn is higher than traditional banks because there&#8217;s no middleman.</p>
<p>Similar to MakerDAO, loans are secured through over-collateralization. Borrowers deposit tokens into Compound to increase their &#8220;borrowing power.&#8221; If the borrower&#8217;s borrowing power falls below 0, their collateral is sold to cover the debt. The interest rates on loans is different for each asset and vary based on the demand for that asset.</p>
<p>On the flip side, lenders earn variable passive interest for supplying tokens to Compound&#8217;s money market. Stablecoins like DAI are arguably the most popular asset to borrow and earn fairly high return rates (historically 5 &#8211; 20% APR) for lenders. When you deposit DAI, you&#8217;re given cDAI tokens in return to represent your deposit and the interest it accrues. This is true for any token or asset deposited into Compound and these tokens are called cTokens.</p>
<p>The exchange rate originally began at 50 cDAI for every one 1 DAI, and as interest accrues in the market, each cDAI will be worth more DAI. The idea is that as your interest accrues, you’ll need less cTokens to redeem your original DAI. In other words, the exchange rate between Dai and cDai grows proportionally with the interest rate.</p>
<p>So by simply owning and holding onto cDAI tokens, you&#8217;re earning passive income in decentralized finance.</p>
<h4>What are the risks involved?</h4>
<p>See the Risks and Considerations section below.</p>
<h1>Earn passive income by lending on Compound</h1>
<h2>1. <b>Create Coinbase account</b></h2>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/daley_e6">Coinbase</a>. Follow the account creation process and be sure to use your real name as it appears on your passport or government ID. Also, make sure you use a <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/creating-strong-passwords">secure password</a> and email (account recovery is like a backdoor to your account, be sure that door is locked).</p>
<p>Once your information is submitted, you&#8217;ll be required to verify your email. If you don&#8217;t receive the verification email, check your spam folder just in case before resending it. Click the &#8216;Verify Email Address&#8217; button found in your verification email from Coinbase.</p>
<h3>Setup your account</h3>
<p>Now we can setup your Coinbase account by verifying your identity, adding a payment method for later, and securing your account with app-based 2FA.</p>
<h4>Verifying your identity</h4>
<p>First, it&#8217;s going to have you confirm your phone number by sending you a code via SMS. Enter this code to verify your phone number.</p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll be prompted to verify your identity with either your passport, driver&#8217;s license, or some other form of photo ID. This is required for Coinbase to comply with regulators. It also benefits you with higher purchasing limits and in the case you get locked out of your account and they can verify it&#8217;s actually you.</p>
<p>Select the form of ID and follow the prompts to activate your webcam or phone camera. It&#8217;ll have you take a picture of both the front and the back. If the image looks clear, click the &#8216;Finish &amp; start verification&#8217; button.</p>
<p>Coinbase will then review your documents. This process may take a few days.</p>
<h4>Link your bank account to your Coinbase account</h4>
<p>Head to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/settings/linked-accounts">Linked Accounts</a> under your Coinbase account settings, click &#8216;Link a New Account&#8217; and select &#8216;Bank Account&#8217;. Follow the Plaid prompts to access your banking information. If Plaid is unsuccessful, you may need to manually enter your banking information.</p>
<p>Coinbase may use a charge verification to verify your banking details. A charge verification is when Coinbase places two random charges like $1.37 and $1.61 to your account. They ask you to enter the precise amounts they charged by checking your bank statement. Once confirmed, the charges are removed.</p>
<h4>Enabling 2FA</h4>
<p>You&#8217;re likely familiar with <a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-enable-two-factor-authentication">2 form authentication (2FA)</a> or 2-step verification. You&#8217;ve likely come across a time where you need 6 digit code from sent to you via SMS to log into an account. And while this is technically 2FA, it&#8217;s not great and can actually leave you vulnerable if anyone were to get a hold of your phone. This type of attack referred to as a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/sim-swap-attack-defend-phone/">SIM swapping</a>, SIM porting, or SIMjacking is common in cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll show you how to use authenticator apps like Google Authenticator (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a> / <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://authy.com/download/">Authy</a> to secure your Coinbase account instead. Go ahead and install one of these apps onto your phone. Then under your Coinbase account <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/settings/security_settings">security settings</a> &gt; 2-step verification section, select Authenticator. A QR code will be shown on screen. You&#8217;ll take your authenticator app, click the &#8216;+&#8217; button, and scan the QR code.</p>
<p>This QR code is the secret that your app will use to generate new 6 digit one-time codes every 30 seconds or so. The secret is stored locally on your device meaning if you lose your phone you won&#8217;t be able to access these one-time codes. The idea is that without that device an attacker couldn&#8217;t access your account with your login information alone. But, this means that if you lose access to it, neither will you.</p>
<p>On Coinbase, you need to enter these one-time codes to login and perform many of the functions of the service. 2FA can be reset in an absolute emergency but it can take days if not weeks of working with customer service to verify your identity.</p>
<p>We recommend you securely back up this secret somehow BEFORE entering the one-time code to enable 2FA on your Coinbase account, in case of an emergency. Some people print it out and store it in a safe location. Or, you can use another device you own to scan the QR code as well so you have it in two places. You can even allow a trusted family member, friend, or spouse to scan it and store a copy of the secret for you.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t back up your 2FA secret but still have access to your authenticator, you can disable and re-enable 2FA to generate a new secret which can be backed up.</p>

<h2>2. <b>Install MetaMask and setup your Ethereum wallet</b></h2>
<p>MetaMask is a web extension that allows you to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and manages the private keys to your Ethereum wallet in-browser.</p>
<p><a href="https://metamask.io/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7584" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_144-300x170.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="341" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_144-300x170.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_144-768x436.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_144.jpg 907w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>Visit <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask.io</a> and click the orange &#8216;Get Extension&#8217; button This will take you the extension for your browser.  Click the &#8216;Add to Browser&#8217; and &#8216;add&#8217; if a popup appears to install the MetaMask extension to your browser.</p>
<h4>Setting up your MetaMask account / Ethereum wallet</h4>
<p>Once installed, you should see a little orange fox icon to the right of your browser&#8217;s address bar. Click this fox icon and then the &#8216;Continue&#8217; button to begin setting up your account.</p>
<p>Next, you&#8217;ll be prompted for a password for your MetaMask account. Make sure this is a secure password and<strong> do not forget it</strong>. This password is used to encrypt the private keys to your Ethereum wallet file stored locally on your computer. MetaMask will prompt you for this password each time you access the extension. It&#8217;s never a bad idea to write down this password and store in a safe place.</p>
<p>Click &#8216;create&#8217; once you&#8217;ve entered your password. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms of use.</p>
<p>Finally, click the shaded area to reveal your seed phrase. As you may recall, this seed phrase is extremely important because it&#8217;s what allows you to access or recover your wallet if you weren&#8217;t able to remember your password or your MetaMask were to become inaccessible. BACK IT UP and store it in a secure location. If you forget your seed phrase, there is no way to recover any funds stored in the wallets generated by that seed phrase.</p>
<p>Click next after you&#8217;ve created a back up or multiple back ups of your seed phrase. MetaMask then tests if you actually backed it up by making you click each word of your seed phrase in order. Press the &#8216;confirm&#8217; button once you are finished.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you&#8217;ve created your first Ethereum wallet.</p>
<h2>3. <b>Deposit USD/EUR into Coinbase Account</b></h2>
<p>Login to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/join/daley_e6">Coinbase</a>, if you weren&#8217;t already, and navigate to &#8216;<a href="https://www.coinbase.com/accounts/">Accounts</a>&#8216;. Here you should see the currency wallets available to your account. Under the currency of your choice (USD or EUR Wallet), click the deposit button.</p>
<h4>Bank deposit</h4>
<p>You can choose to either deposit from your bank account and wait a few days. Just enter the amount to deposit and hit confirm. Your funds are &#8216;on hold&#8217; while the bank transfer is cleared with your bank. This can take up to 3 &#8211; 7 days depending on your bank.</p>
<h4>Wire transfer</h4>
<p>Or, you can choose to send your money with a Wire Transfer but it&#8217;ll cost you a $10 wire fee. Bank wire transfers may be credited to your Coinbase account on the same day if submitted by 1:00 PM PT. Otherwise, funds will be available after one business day.</p>
<h2><b>4. Transfer to Coinbase Pro</b></h2>
<p>Navigate to <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/">Coinbase Pro</a>, a cryptocurrency exchange run by Coinbase, and login in using your Coinbase login information. These accounts are linked by default and so share the same login.</p>
<p>Once logged in, click the &#8216;My Wallets&#8217; button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Then, click &#8216;Deposit&#8217; which will popup a menu where you&#8217;ll select your US Dollar or Euros.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7618 size-full" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_164.jpg" alt="" width="703" height="599" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_164.jpg 703w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_164-300x256.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px" /></p>
<p>Select the &#8216;Coinbase Account&#8217; option on the right side. Enter the amount you&#8217;d like to deposit or simply hit &#8216;Max&#8217; and then click the &#8216;Deposit&#8217; button at the bottom of the window. Your funds should transfer instantly unless they are still on hold.</p>
<h2>5. <b>Convert USD/EUR to DAI</b></h2>
<h4>Purchasing ETH</h4>
<p>Follow the link for your currency (<a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/ETH-USD">USD</a> or <a href="https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/ETH-EUR">EUR</a>). On the left side of the page you should see your Wallet Balance and below that Order Form.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting here that cryptocurrencies like ETH are relatively new and their value can be quite volatile. <strong>Never invest more than you are willing to lose!</strong></p>
<p>Select &#8216;Buy&#8217;, &#8216;Market&#8217;, and enter the amount of money you&#8217;d like to spend or &#8216;Max&#8217;. Verify the details of your trade and click &#8216;Place Buy Order.&#8217; You&#8217;re now the proud owner of Ether (ETH).</p>
<h4>Withdrawing your ETH to MetaMask</h4>
<p>Let&#8217;s withdraw your ETH to your MetaMask wallet. Under &#8216;Wallet Balance&#8217; on the left side, click the &#8216;Withdraw&#8217; button. Select &#8216;Ether&#8217; in the popup window. Now, click the MetaMask icon at the top of your browser window to open up MetaMask&#8217;s menu. Above your wallet balance and the Ether symbol, you should see your &#8216;Account #&#8217; and part of your wallet address.</p>
<p>If you hover over this and click it, it will copy your wallet address to your clipboard. Paste this into &#8216;Destination&#8217; field in the Coinbase Pro Withdraw ETH popup window. Be sure to double check the address because Ethereum transactions are irreversible and you cannot retrieve funds sent to an address you don&#8217;t own.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve verified the address, enter the amount of ETH to withdraw and click &#8216;Withdraw ETH&#8217; button. You&#8217;ll be prompted to enter the 6 digits from your 2FA app. After you&#8217;re finished, your funds will be sent from Coinbase to your MetaMask wallet momentarily.</p>
<h4>Swap ETH for DAI</h4>
<p>Open <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a>, a DEX aggregator or website which searches across the top DEXes to find you the best price for your trade.</p>
<p><a href="https://dex.ag/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7614" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_162-282x300.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="744" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_162-282x300.jpg 282w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_162-768x816.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_162.jpg 861w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></a></p>
<p>By default, DEX.AG is set to BUY Dai with ETH. For the purposes of this guide, let&#8217;s switch to SELL ETH for DAI. Next, enter the amount of ETH you&#8217;d like to swap for DAI. You can check your total ETH balance under MetaMask.</p>
<p><strong>DO NOT</strong> enter your total balance to swap &#8211; You need to keep some ETH to pay for network transaction fees called gas. Your typical transaction will cost you between $0.10 to as high as a few dollars depending on what type of transaction you&#8217;re sending and the network fees at that moment; so keep at least few dollars worth of ETH for this swap and future transactions from your wallet. For reference, at the time of writing this ETH&#8217;s price is currently ~$213 so keeping anywhere between 0.05 and 0.1 ETH in your wallet would more than cover any transaction fees for a while.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve entered the amount (minus the ETH set aside for gas), click the &#8216;Find Trades&#8217; button. You should see a list of DEXes appear on your screen. Then, click the &#8216;Sell Now&#8217; button on the DEX closest to the top. This will initiate a trade with the DEX you&#8217;ve selected with the details you&#8217;ve previously entered. A MetaMask prompt will appear.</p>
<p>Since this is the first time your account is interacting with this DEX smart contract, you&#8217;ll have to send two transactions: an approval transaction and then the transaction with your trade. The first time you interact with a smart contract you must submit an Approve transaction which enables that smart contract to transfer your tokens like DAI when necessary.</p>
<p>You have the option to manually adjust your transaction or gas fee before sending. This could potentially save you time (preventing a transaction that might get stuck with too low of fees) and money. Click &#8216;EDIT&#8217; under the &#8216;Gas Fee&#8217; row of this window &gt; Advanced tab at the top of the window. You can always check <a href="http://ethgasstation.info/">ETH Gas Station</a> for the recommended fast gas price. Enter your desired amount into the &#8216;Gas Price&#8217; box. Click &#8216;Save&#8217; and then &#8216;Confirm&#8217; to send your transaction.</p>
<p>Wait a few moments for the transaction to be confirmed. To follow the confirmation status of your transaction, open the MetaMask menu, click the pending transaction and click the diagonal arrow on the right which reads &#8216;View on Etherscan&#8217; on hovered over. Etherscan is a block explorer where you can follow transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.</p>
<p>Once confirmed, click the &#8216;Sell Now&#8217; button for that same DEX again. This will initiate your trade. Repeat the step above to confirm and send your transaction. The DAI should arrive in your wallet once its confirmed.</p>
<h2>6. Turn DAI into cDAI via Compound Finance</h2>
<h4>Compare lending rates</h4>
<p>Normally, I&#8217;d recommend you <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">compare interest rates</a> before choosing a lending service. But for the simplicity&#8217;s sake, we&#8217;ll be teaching you to use the arguably most popular DeFi lending service Compound Finance.</p>
<h4><a href="https://app.compound.finance/asset/cDAI"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7617" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_163-300x273.jpg" alt="" width="725" height="660" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_163-300x273.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_163-768x699.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Selection_163.jpg 934w" sizes="(max-width: 725px) 100vw, 725px" /></a></h4>
<h4>Enable DAI on Compound</h4>
<p>Navigate to the <a href="https://app.compound.finance/">Compound app</a>. If not prompted, connect your MetaMask wallet by selecting the button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Select MetaMask and unlock your wallet. Next, select <a href="https://app.compound.finance/asset/cDAI">Dai</a> from the menu and click the green &#8216;Enable DAI&#8217; button. This will pop up an Approve transaction which you&#8217;ll confirm using the same steps as before. To follow the confirmation status of your transaction, open the MetaMask menu, click the pending transaction and click the diagonal arrow on the right.</p>
<h4>Supply DAI to Compound and begin earning interest</h4>
<p>Once your approve transaction is confirmed, you should see two buttons: a green &#8216;Supply&#8217; button and a purple &#8216;Borrow&#8217; button under the Dai section of Compound. Click &#8216;Supply&#8217; and enter the amount of DAI you&#8217;d like to supply/lend (or select MAX). After entering in the amount, click the &#8216;Supply&#8217; button at the bottom of the pop-up menu which will open up a MetaMask transaction. Confirm the details of this transaction like before, click &#8216;Confirm&#8217;, and then wait for the transaction to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Congratulations! With your cDAI now in your MetaMask wallet, you&#8217;re gaining passive interest every 12 seconds. You can view the current interest rate at <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">DeFi Pulse</a> or <a href="https://compound.finance/markets">Compound</a> under Dai Supply APR. Welcome to the future of finance.</p>
<h1>Risks and Considerations</h1>
<h4>You can forget your seed phrase or not properly back them up</h4>
<p>If you lose access to your wallet and do not have your seed phrase, there&#8217;s no way to recover the funds locked inside that wallet. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important for you to write down the seed phrase and store it somewhere safe.</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s never a bad idea to consider what might happen in an emergency. What if your house burned down? Having an extra copy of your seed phrase secured off-site (i.e. in a safety deposit box) is never a bad idea.</p>
<h4>Your seed phrase could be stolen whether physically or digitally <b></b></h4>
<p>As previously mentioned, if someone gets access to your seed phrase, they can take allow of your assets stored within that wallet. NEVER enter your seed phrase into a website. Phishing emails and websites are common ways for thieves to deceive users into divulging their private key or seed phrase.</p>
<h4><b>There can be flaws, bugs or vulnerabilities in Maker affecting DAI</b></h4>
<p>Maker takes risk seriously with systems in place to manage risk within its smart contract credit system as well as in that system&#8217;s programming. Several <a href="https://github.com/makerdao/audits">third party audits</a> have been conducted on Maker&#8217;s code to sweep for bugs.</p>
<p>These precautions are very important to minimizing the risk in the system. However, there are still possible risks. The Maker team has put together a comprehensive <a href="https://makerdao.com/en/whitepaper/#risks-and-their-mitigation">Risks and their Mitigations section</a> in their whitepaper. And here&#8217;s a 3 part <a href="https://medium.com/makerdao/makerdao-governance-risk-framework-38625f514101">blog series</a> outlining their Governance Risk Framework. In this framework, dedicated risk teams construct risk management models for the entire collateral portfolio. Careful management of risk in their asset portfolio helps ensure the system remains stable even in times of high market volatility.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a risk that is known but its not possible to eliminate at this time. Maker uses a set of off-chain price feeds to determine the price of ETH on-chain. MakerDAO&#8217;s medianizer smart contract finds the median price between all the feeds which is then used for nearly every function of a CDP. These price feeds could be manipulated by an attacker or the medianizer itself could subject to a bug or undiscovered vulnerability. To date, no such attack or bug has occurred.</p>
<h4><b>There can be flaws, bugs or vulnerabilities in Compound affecting cDAI</b></h4>
<p>Compound&#8217;s code has been audited several times. The most <a href="https://blog.openzeppelin.com/compound-audit/">recent audit</a> performed in August 2019 by OpenZepplin found no bugs of Critical Severity. However, a few risks were found in the design of their incentive structure. Previously, Trail of Bits performed <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/compound-2.pdf">audited</a> Compound&#8217;s v2 upgrade in May 2019. Compound has also been formally verified in partnership with <a class="di ca lm ln lo lp" href="https://www.certora.com/?source=post_page---------------------------">Certora</a>.</p>
<p>Compound Labs, Inc., the developer of the protocol, currently controls the admin address for Compound. The admin address has the right to support additional assets, upgrade the price feed oracle, upgrade the interest rate models, and upgrade the risk model of the protocol. While they plan on fully decentralizing this and handing control to the community, in the meantime the admin address introduces possible vulnerabilities (as expressed by community member Ameen Soleimani to the integrity of Compound&#8217;s function. It should be noted that such vulnerabilities or attacks have not occurred to date.</p>
<h4><b>You could die rendering your cryptocurrency inaccessible to friends or family</b></h4>
<p>Life is unpredictable, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t plan for the worst. Consider how your friends or loved ones would go about accessing your wallet if something were to happen to you. There&#8217;s no perfect solution to this problem. So, you&#8217;ll have to come up with a plan that works best for you.</p>
<h4><b>Know the legal and tax obligations</b></h4>
<p>We aren&#8217;t going to give you legal or tax advice. Nor are we qualified to. However, you should be aware that owning cryptocurrency, like any financial asset, comes with tax repercussions. And, you&#8217;ll almost definitely owe taxes for earning interest in DeFi. Consult a tax professional in your area for more information.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Don&#8217;t let this final section of risks and considerations scare you though. Any and every investment in the world comes with varying degrees of risk. It&#8217;s up to you to exercise proper to take precautions and mitigate those risks. DeFi is no different. By taking precautions like never investing more than you are willing to lose tomorrow, you can take advantage of the opportunities that exist in DeFi without being irresponsible.</p>
<p>Most of all, <strong>CONGRATULATIONS</strong> on joining the digital economy of of the future. Decentralized finance is still growing financial sector full of opportunities. In the world of DeFi, innovations happen at a breakneck pace with new products and services being launched everyday. And now, you&#8217;re part of this special moment of history in the making.</p>

<h3>cDai is like an instant Dai savings account</h3>
<p>Lending is one of the most popular ways in DeFi to earn interest. But did you know it just got easier than ever? As you may know, <a href="https://defipulse.com/compound">Compound</a>, a money market protocol, allows you to earn a variable interest rate in return for supplying tokens that other users can borrow. The protocol recently upgraded to v2, which includes a big development that everyone&#8217;s talking about: the addition of Compound tokens, or <em>cTokens</em>, including cDai, cETH, and more.</p>
<p>Previously, Compound used a single smart contract for all assets. With the upgrade, each token on Compound has its own contract, called an <em>asset gateway</em>. That&#8217;s a big deal, because now when you deposit tokens into Compound, you get cTokens &#8211; ERC20 tokens that represent your lending or supply balance and the interest it has accrued.</p>
<p>So how does that work exactly?</p>
<h3>Let&#8217;s look at an example</h3>
<p>Previously, in Compound v1, the interest you earned was simply added to your account balance, and it remained in Compound. However, now when you supply Dai to Compound in v2, you&#8217;ll receive cDai in exchange. The exchange rate began at 50 cDai for every one 1 Dai, and as interest accrues in the market, each cDai will be worth more Dai. The idea is that as your interest accrues, you&#8217;ll need less cTokens to redeem your underlying assets. In other words, the exchange rate between Dai and cDai grows proportionally with the interest rate.</p>
<h3>What makes cDai so awesome?</h3>
<p>The simple answer is that by designing cTokens as ERC20 tokens, Compound has opened up a whole new world of functionality and liquidity. All the assets that used to stay locked away in Compound are now free to move about the ecosystem, ready to be utilized for other purposes.</p>
<p>You can transfer, trade, or send cTokens to cold storage, just like any other token on Ethereum. In fact, you can even integrate them into other protocols. That is, any protocol where you can lock tokens could choose to accept any cToken. This would allow you to earn interest on top of the benefits the protocol already gives you.</p>
<h3>Showcasing DeFi&#8217;s composability</h3>
<p>The perfect example of this new interoperability is the <a href="https://defipulse.com/uniswap">Uniswap</a> Dai-to-cDai liquidity pool. Users (and smart contracts) can swap their Dai or any token for that matter into cTokens to take advantage of Compound&#8217;s interest-based exchange rate. And compared to simply holding Dai, pooling cDai earns you interest while also exposing you to trading fees on Uniswap.</p>
<p><strong>You can try it right now</strong>: start earning interest by swapping any token for cDai in seconds with <a href="http://cDAI.io/">cDAI.io</a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re excited to see what other unique and creative ways the community will take advantage of cTokens.
