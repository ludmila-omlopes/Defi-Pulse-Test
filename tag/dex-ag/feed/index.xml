To participate in future AMAs, please join our <a href="https://discord.gg/Gx4TCTk">Discord</a> and follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/defipulse">Twitter</a>.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><strong>Chaz Schmidt:<em> </em></strong><em>Hello and welcome @everyone! Thank you for joining us today for an AMA with Clinton Bembry Jr., CEO of Slingshot ( @Clinton | Slingshot ).&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>The AMA will last around 30 minutes and will be made available shortly after for those who could not attend.</em></p>



<p><em>Clinton will be answering the questions we&#8217;ve collected from the community throughout the week. A special thanks to those of you who submitted questions for today&#8217;s AMA.</em><strong><em><br></em></strong><strong><em><br></em></strong><strong>How&#8217;s it going Clinton?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton Bembry Jr.:</strong> Hey Chaz! doing well, hbu?</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Not too shabby. Thanks everyone for showing up for the AMA. Let&#8217;s start off with a rather easy question&#8230;</em></p>



<p><strong>What is Slingshot?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton:</strong> sweet, Slingshot is a decentralized trading platform that aggregates liquidity across DEX protocols (like uniswap, sushiswap, curve, etc.) to offer user sthe best prices on their trades. We place a huge emphasis on user-experience and aim to offer the ultimate trading experience for both DeFi natives and newcomers to crypto!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>This next one comes from the Slingshot Discord where folks are clamoring for more details on Slingshot ever since your initial teaser earlier this year.</em></p>



<p><strong>What will separate Slingshot from all other DEXes already operating? Uniswap, SushiSwap, LinkSwap, DODO, etc.</strong><br><br><strong>Clinton:</strong> so Slingshot itself isn&#8217;t a DEX, we plug our liquidity engine into other DEXes like uniswap and sushiswap etc</p>



<p>By aggregating liquidity and splitting orders between other DEXes we are able to offer much better prices than if you were to trade on an individual DEX<br><br>Slingshot isn&#8217;t just about the best prices, but also unparalleled user-experience</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I know for many DeFi users fees can be a big factor when it comes to user experience.</em><br><br><strong>How does Slingshot plan to support trading on layer 2 or multiple chains?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>definitely, many people (myself included) got priced out of trading on Ethereum L1</p>



<p>At launch we will suport trading on Polygon, which is an Ethereum L2/sidechain. The tx fee on Polygon for a trade is as low as $0.0002, compared to Ethereum which can be a $100+ fee per trade</p>



<p>At Slingshot we&#8217;re all about pricing people back into DeFi <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS:</strong><em> Sounds good to me. I like low fees. I saw in your Discord that Closed Beta users have been able to use Slingshot on Polygon already.</em></p>



<p><strong>What has been the most useful feedback from the closed beta so far?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton:</strong> Our polygon support is a result of the feedback we received from our earliest beta users. Due to high fees they were being forced to turn back to the world centralized trading. We began working on L2 support immediately and shipped it a few weeks later.</p>



<p>other than that &#8211; it&#8217;s been very helpful in general to hear which features users want to see to aid in their trading flows</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>That actually leads straight into my next question which is:</em><strong> What features of Slingshot are you most excited for the public to see?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>aside from the lightning fast L2 trading + unbeatable prices, i&#8217;m personally excited for people to experience all of the real-time, on-chain data we pump through our platform.</p>



<p>Every time a block get&#8217;s mined we parse all trading activity and surface it to our users and it makes for a visceral experience!</p>



<p>oh also &#8211; our price charts are custom made and look really cool :sunglasses:</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I can attest to this personally. I&#8217;ve gotten a chance to test Slingshot in the beta and I found myself getting lost in it like it is a game. The flow from seeing a price change on the ticker, clicking it to select the token, and executing the trade was incredible. A community member wanted to know more about the sci-fi browser game that Slingshot produced where players could win their way into the beta.</em><strong> In their words, &#8220;What was the point of the game?&#8221; And, will other aspects of Slingshot involve gamification?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>the point of the game was&nbsp; to announce our closed-beta and bootstrap an initial user-base, while also having some fun while we build the future of finance!<br><br>I mean, how else are you supposed to announce a beta?</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Solid point haha</em><br><br><em>And it was fun. One player was even so fast they were accused of being a robot</em> <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f916.png" alt="ðŸ¤–" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>haha yes, a bit of a speed-running competition broke out! as far as I could tell, they were all legit, no bots!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>We&#8217;re reaching near the end now and it&#8217;s been super interesting so far. If you&#8217;re up for it Clinton, we have a couple more of questions before we let you go</em></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>Of course!<br><br><strong>CS: </strong><em>I think the audience would get angry if I didn&#8217;t ask the obvious: </em><strong>When launch?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>soon <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="â„¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> bahaha<br>forreal though &#8211; very soon<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="â„¢" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>We&#8217;ll accept that answer.</em><br><br><strong>Clinton: </strong>we want to get Slingshout out publicly for everyone to use ASAP</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>I think that&#8217;s about all the questions we have time for.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you for joining us Clinton. I know I for one am excited for Slingshot to go live.</em></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>awesome, thanks for having me!</p>



<p>quick plug &#8211; we&#8217;re hiring for a lot of roles at Slingshot. If you&#8217;re interested in helping us build the future of trading, <a href="https://slingshot-finance.homerun.co/">check out our job postings here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Haha yes. Be sure to reach out if you fit those roles lol</em></p>



<p><strong>Anything else you&#8217;d like to add before we go?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Clinton: </strong>that&#8217;s all from me!</p>



<p><strong>CS: </strong><em>Well it was a pleasure talking with you</em></p>



<p><em>Thank you everyone for attending! I hope your curiosities were satisfied.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>TLDR: </strong><a href="https://docs.dex.ag/proxy-contract">Integrating DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster with custom fees</a> into your platform provides your users or smart contract with convenient native liquidity while allowing you to build a sustainable business model.</em></p>



<h2>Liquidity is vital for the growth of DeFi</h2>



<p>Users want to experience all DeFi has to offer. But often times to do that you  need to swap between tokens or stablecoins. Liquidity is an important resource that enables DeFi&#8217;s composability and makes it possible for many DApps to function. It&#8217;s the blood that flows through the veins of DeFi. </p>



<p>For a smooth user experience, it&#8217;s essential to have a reliable liquidity at a decent price. DEXes are an obvious choice for reliable liquidity when designing an application or smart contract. However, relying on a single DEX comes with its disadvantages. For example, maybe the token your users want to trade isn&#8217;t listed or has extremely low liquidity causing costly price slippage. </p>



<h3>DeFi is all about having options</h3>



<p>If one DEX isn&#8217;t ideal, The obvious answer is to do what DeFi does best with money legos and combine the awesome powers of DEXes. That&#8217;s why we built our other service DEX.AG, a DEX aggregator. DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster let&#8217;s you trade multiple DEXes and even splits trades across the combination of DEXes that results in the best price. Each DEX has its strengths, the X Blaster combines those strengths and connects users with the DEX or DEXes that best suits their needs. Not to mention, the X Blaster&#8217;s API has a blazing fast response time that delivers available trades within a fraction of a second so users never wait.</p>



<h4>X Blaster <strong>aggregates liquidity from popular DEXes: </strong></h4>



<ul><li>0x v3</li><li>Bancor</li><li>Curve</li><li>Kyber</li><li>Oasis</li><li>Uniswap</li><li>Synthetix<br>&#8230;. and more</li></ul>



<p>With each new update, new tokens, exchanges, and integrations like Compound cTokens and CHAI are added to the X Blaster. We focus on token listings and improving your integrated X Blaster so you can focus on what matters.</p>



<h2>Custom fees enable flexible and sustainable business models</h2>



<p>We built DEX.AG because we understand the power of bringing the community together and the value that can create. We see our proxy contracts with custom fees as an opportunity for teams build sustainable models and grow their communities.</p>



<p>We know how crucial the right business model can be to finding the perfect product-market fit. You choose the custom fees on your X Blaster proxy contract. Developers know their users best and this gives them the flexibility to grow their community on their terms. </p>



<h2>X Blaster in action</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is changing the way people interact with their money.Â  However, we know it can be a lot to take in. Don&#8217;t worry, because we&#8217;ve put together this quick guide to give you jump start.</p>
<h2>Start making money on DeFi in 4 steps</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with Ethereum, these steps will only take a few minutes. And when it&#8217;s all said and done, you&#8217;ll be earning interest in DAI every block.Â <em><strong>However if you&#8217;re completely new to Ethereum,</strong></em>Â you may instead want to check outÂ <strong><a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/zero-to-defi-cdai/">Zero to DeFi</a></strong>, a beginner&#8217;s guide which breaks down the entire process of getting a wallet, acquiring ETH, and lending out your DAI.</p>
<h3>1. Get ETH into an address that you own</h3>
<p>As the saying goes, if you don&#8217;t hold the private keys to the wallet, then they aren&#8217;t your coins. So, be sure to perform these steps from a wallet that you hold the private keys to. And, don&#8217;t forget to keep them backed up somewhere safe.</p>
<h3>2. Head toÂ <a href="https://dex.ag/">DEX.AG</a> and sell most of that ETH for DAI</h3>
<p><a href="http://DEX.AG/">DEX.AG</a> is a decentralized exchange or DEX aggregator that gets you the best price available from several of the most popular DEXes. It even splits your trade across multiple DEXes if it improves the price, all in one transaction.Â <strong>Make sure to leave a little ETH leftover for <a href="https://ethgasstation.info/blog/what-is-gas/">gas fees</a>.</strong></p>
<h3><a href="https://dex.ag/"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7722" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300.jpg 1000w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-300x300.jpg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-150x150.jpg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_300-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></h3>
<h3>3. Go to DeFi Pulse&#8217;sÂ <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">Earn Income page</a></h3>
<p>DeFi Pulse is a site where you can find the latest analytics and rankings of DeFi protocols. The DeFi Pulse <a href="https://defipulse.com/income">Earn Income page</a> compares the interest rates you can earn from DeFi lending protocols.</p>
<p><a href="https://defipulse.com/income"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-7715" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-260x300.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="693" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-260x300.jpg 260w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-886x1024.jpg 886w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295-768x887.jpg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Selection_295.jpg 934w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h3>4. Pick a lending protocol, and start earning interest</h3>
<p>Enter the asset and amount you wish to lend to find which lending protocol has the best interest rate. Pick a protocol and click the &#8216;Next&#8217; button which will redirect you to that app/service. Compound finance is currently the most popular lending protocol. Follow the app&#8217;s instructions to begin lending out your DAI and start earning interest.</p>
<h3>And then later, when you&#8217;re ready to cash out&#8230;</h3>
<p>Head back to the lending protocol you chose and use your private key to unlock the DAI plus interest generated whenever you want. There&#8217;s no &#8220;lock-in&#8221; period or time you have to wait before earning interest. Your DAI is earning interest every block until you choose to stop.</p>
