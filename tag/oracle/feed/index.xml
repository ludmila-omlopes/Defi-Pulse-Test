<p><strong><em>Today, we interview UMA co-founder Allison Lu who talks about her and her team&#8217;s mission to bring market access to everyone through synthetic asset tokens, decentralized oracles, and priceless financial contracts.</em></strong></p>



<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>



<p>Starting in late-2017, my co-founder Hart and I were exploring various ideas for blockchain-based solutions to problems within the financial services industry. Our method was to go through the history of financial innovations, and we very quickly came to financial derivatives. We realized that blockchain-based financial contracts had the capacity to help people all over the world leapfrog the existing fiat financial infrastructure in their countries and attain Universal Market Access. </p>



<p>We always knew that in building infrastructure to create financial contracts, that our protocol would need an oracle. As we started to conduct R&amp;D on oracles, we realized that if we wanted to build a protocol that could scale to support trillions of dollars of economic value, we needed an oracle with economic guarantees. So, we also developed the <a href="https://twitter.com/hal2001/status/1149466877543845888?lang=en">Data Verification Mechanism</a>. </p>



<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>



<p>UMA builds financial infrastructure on Ethereum. Specifically this is two things: </p>



<ol><li>The Data Verification Mechanism (DVM), a decentralized oracle service </li><li>Priceless financial contract designs, which can be used to create synthetic tokens</li></ol>



<p>The DVM is optimized for maintaining economic security for the contracts that use it. The DVM design itself is based on a bold claim that any on-chain oracle can be corrupted. This means that any smart contract relying on off-chain data is manipulatable for some price. Our solution is to introduce a simple economic security framework for evaluating oracles. We look at the potential profit from corruption (PfC) and cost of corruption (CoC) of contracts in our system, and have designed a mechanism to ensure that the cost of corrupting our oracle will exceed the potential profit. In doing so, we eliminate the economic incentives for corrupting our oracle in the first place.</p>



<p>The second part of what we build is priceless financial contracts. Priceless financial contracts don’t require an on-chain price feed to function, and minimize on-chain oracle usage to reduce the frequency and surface area for oracle attacks. Previously in DeFi, when oracle failures happened, most were live and brief. In contrast, priceless contracts, when they require a price from the oracle, look backwards in time, which makes the price more secure.</p>



<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>



<p>We’re a financial infrastructure company, so our users are developers, who generally in turn have their own customers.</p>



<p>Project developers use our financial contract factories to define custom synthetic tokens that track things like local currencies, real world assets, or cross-chain assets. Their users can then interact with these synthetic tokens through any interface supporting the ERC20 standard, or mint new tokens from a custom UI. These projects cover a range of use cases, including local payments, investments, and speculation.</p>



<p>In addition to project developers, UMA also relies on a network of liquidators and disputers to ensure that synthetic tokens remain pegged to the target price and that each token contract remains solvent. Economic incentives embedded in Priceless contracts encourage DeFi community members to run these liquidation and dispute “bots.”</p>



<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>



<p>Near-term, I’m most excited about revealing the synthetic tokens that our user base has been developing. We (or our partners) ran a number of POCs the past year to validate users’ interest in synthetic tokens, and many are now gearing up for broader release. You’ll be hearing more and more from our partners in 2020.</p>



<p>Very long-term, I’m excited to make myself obsolete! What I mean is that UMA token holders have control over the UMA ecosystem in the form of tokenholder-driven governance. Over time, we want to reduce the role of core devs and help the community self-organize to maintain and build what it needs.</p>



<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>



<p>Digital assets on Ethereum (including ETH itself) already have immense economic value. DeFi has given users an ability to do something with those assets while still retaining control over their private keys: store it, trade it, borrow against it, etc. UMA adds another composable capability: the ability to transform the economic value of a user’s assets into the risk of something else. Imagine being able to use ETH to also hedge against the risk of your BTC holdings. Or using Dai to access global stock indices. Or locking in interest rates across different DeFi protocols.</p>



<p>In the long run, we see the DVM securing all kinds of different financial contracts, and the ability for everyone who can access DeFi to also have Universal Market Access.</p>



<h3>What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</h3>



<p>Oracle Extractable Value, or OEV. We’re all familiar with Miner-Extractable-Value, as popularized by “Flash Boys 2.0,” but I think users are less familiar with oracle-extractable-value. The general idea is similar: entities that control oracles can also extract profit by manipulating the oracle price and then interacting with the permissionless smart contracts that use them. Almost all of DeFi depends on oracles at some level to function, and the surface area for attack, mistakes, and OEV is huge &#8211; and getting worse. That’s why we believe so strongly in the Priceless design framework, which has core design principles anchored in a) minimizing oracle usage; and b) only if absolutely necessary, using an asynchronous oracle with economic guarantees (the DVM).</p>

<p><em><strong><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-7855 size-full aligncenter" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DFP-augur-defi-dive-twitter-thumbnail.png" alt="" width="1024" height="512" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DFP-augur-defi-dive-twitter-thumbnail.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DFP-augur-defi-dive-twitter-thumbnail-300x150.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2019/12/DFP-augur-defi-dive-twitter-thumbnail-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>We spoke with&nbsp;Peter Vecchiarelli, Operations at Augur, a bit about where Augur&#8217;s been and where it&#8217;s headed&#8230;</strong></em></p>
<h3>How did you get your start in crypto and what inspired you to build your project, product, or service?</h3>
<p>Augur was started by Joey Krug in the following manner:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;I got involved in Bitcoin in 2011 by mining Bitcoin. In 2013, I built a Bitcoin point of sale system, but ended up abandoning it after realizing that the most powerful applications of blockchain tech would not involve the external world much because it adds in trusted third parties and gets rid of a lot of the benefits. In 2014, I dropped out of Pomona College to cofound one of the first projects on Ethereum called Augur, and in 2015 we did the first crowdsale on Ethereum.&#8221;</em></p>
<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?</h3>
<p>Augur is a decentralized oracle and prediction market platform. It is one of a few use cases that is dependent on censorship-resistance.</p>
<p>Markets on the outcome of events are highly regulated in some jurisdictions and Augur&#8217;s censorship-resistance by way of using a decentralized blockchain allows for an unstoppable system. If this system thrives, the byproduct is that prices in the market outcomes would become the most accurate information signal on the probability of events.</p>
<p>What sets it apart from centralized competitors such as Betfair and Predictit is the lack of limits imposed by regulations or profit motive. On Augur, there are no limits on what you can bet on, how much, where from, etc. Additionally, because Augur is not for-profit, it is able to facilitate the lowest fees and unbeatable odds.</p>
<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?</h3>
<p>The ideal user is anyone who participates in betting or financial markets but is limited by how much they can bet, what they can bet on, where they can bet from, or is de-platformed for winning too much.</p>
<p>For example, PredictIt, a regulated political prediction market platform imposes an $850 limit for each market per participant. On other online betting platforms, if you consistently win, you&#8217;ll be kicked or have your betting maximums severely reduced. Others aren&#8217;t able to access the markets they&#8217;d like to participate in due to the geography they live in.</p>
<p>These limitations distort the signal that a robust betting market conveys.</p>
<h3>What future event or feature on your roadmap are you most excited for?</h3>
<p>Glad you asked! We are launching v2 of the Augur platform in Q1 2020.</p>
<p>This release features the adoption of a stable betting unit (McDai), a faster, more intuitive UI, quicker market resolutions, and several months post-launch we&#8217;ll be introducing a very slick betting UI.</p>
<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?</h3>
<p>We believe prediction markets are a vital engine for a parallel financial system. Because Augur is an open system with composability, there are literally endless applications for implementing Augur into products and services.</p>
<h3><span class="Text-wqps8m-0 answer__QuestionText-sc-1k75oj5-0 jWxpxy" data-qa="response-question">What’s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?</span></h3>
<div class="Spacer-cjod5i-0 frBWpl">We may be a bit contrarian here, but we believe that it&#8217;s important to consider centralization and trust minimization at every junction. In the thorny path towards product-market fit, it can be tempting to stray from an initial vision of decentralization, but we think the true potential of a parallel financial system becomes possible with protocols that don&#8217;t waver on this.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Smart contracts exist on the blockchain and can only access data available on-chain. They rely on what&#8217;s called an oracle to interact with real world, or off-chain, data. An oracle is a source of data that is being fed to a smart contract. For example, oracles provide data like the price of a stock, weather data like temperatures, or even the outcome of a sporting event.</p>
<h3>Oracles are divided into two categories: software and hardware.</h3>
<p>Software oracles relay information to smart contracts from the digital world outside the Ethereum blockchain. This information comes from online sources like websites, backend APIs, or even other smart contracts. Weather data, stock prices, flight schedules, sporting event results, etc are all common examples of information software oracles can provide.</p>
<p>Hardware oracles use equipment to inform smart contracts what&#8217;s happening in the physical world. Hardware oracles often utilize Internet of things, or IoT, devices. These devices track and verify real world data before sending it to the smart contract. Common examples include thermometers, supply chain RFID tags, GPS data, etc.</p>
<h3>Oracles have their ups and downs</h3>
<p>While oracles enable new possibilities for smart contracts, they also introduce potential risks. Smart contracts trust the information given to them by oracles. And, this data is often critical to how the smart contract functions. What would happen if an attacker hijacking the data feed? Or, what if the source of information simply malfunctions? Consequently, Developers have to take these risks into consideration when designing oracles. Decentralizing oracles across multiple sources of data helps mitigate some of these risks.</p>
