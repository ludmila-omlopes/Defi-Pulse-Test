<p>Following its stated goal to establish standards that the community can stand behind, <a href="https://defipulse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi Pulse</a> (through <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pulse.inc/" target="_blank">Pulse Inc</a>) has developed different methodologies to tackle the market&#8217;s increased interest in tokenized indices, which are spreading wildly across DeFi and becoming more and more popular every day.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Today, the second product of the FLI series, <a href="https://pulseinc.medium.com/flexible-leverage-index-btc2x-fli-launch-755605f45468">the Bitcoin Flexible Leverage Index (BTC2x-FLI), was introduced</a>, and we want to expand into how it works and the story of how it was designed.</strong></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="879" height="242" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-16.15.25-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-9269" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-16.15.25-1.png 879w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-16.15.25-1-300x83.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-16.15.25-1-768x211.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Screen-Shot-2021-05-11-at-16.15.25-1-585x161.png 585w" sizes="(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px" /></figure>



<h2>Index tokens: what are they?</h2>



<p>Index tokens are similar to TradFi&#8217;s ETFs and ETNs, collective investment funds that seek to track the performance of a benchmark index but offer several advantages over these more traditional instruments, especially for new entrants. Index tokens can also be attractive to passive participants with a lack of time or knowledge of a specific strategy or market.</p>



<p>Besides keeping track of a specific market, index tokens can also represent structured financial products with sophisticated strategies. The <a href="https://www.pulse.inc/flexible-leverage-index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flexible Leverage Index (FLI)</a> is a prime example, tokenizing a collateralized debt position in a single ERC-20 token to allow investors to have leveraged exposure in one click. While users today enjoy the stress-free leverage FLI’s strategy provides, it took several years for the concept of FLI to come to fruition.</p>



<h2>The birth of the FLI methodology</h2>



<p>Ten years before co-founding DeFi Pulse, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-lewis-2a554430/" target="_blank">Scott Lewis</a> used to work for the global trading and technology firm Susquehanna International Group where, as a derivatives trader, he developed the best strategies to find profitable trades. While working there, he first envisioned the design of the FLI methodology, even though TradFi was not fertile ground to quickly develop these kinds of financial products. </p>



<p>In Scott&#8217;s words:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“I was using autoregressive models in some of my derivative tradings, and I realized that an index in which the leverage automatically regressed to a target leverage ratio would greatly reduce the product’s rebalancing needs.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>The usual way to get leverage in the DeFi space is by understanding and executing a complex series of steps. First, investors need to provide collateral to a given protocol and withdraw debt. Afterward, this debt has to be allocated to that same protocol or a different one, and, depending on the strategy and the amount of required leverage, these steps have to be repeated multiple times. Throughout this process, investors need to continuously monitor the market to ensure they don’t get liquidated. The FLI methodology delegates all the above steps to the issuer, offering the investor a leveraged position with targeted exposure to an asset in the form of an ERC-20 token.</p>



<p>The TradFi approach to leveraged ETFs also has other inefficiencies, as Scott’s points out:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p><em>“Leverage products frequently track an index that returns the exact leverage ratio each 24 hours period. This inflexibility results in some of these products having to buy and sell a significant amount of assets each and every day. All this trading can create bad returns for the users of these products.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Even though the FLI methodology targets a 2x leverage ratio, it uses a tolerance range and an algorithm that reduces rebalancing needs by order of magnitude, thereby increasing the gas efficiency, which translates into direct <strong>savings by the holder</strong>.</p>



<h2>The Bitcoin Flexible Leverage Index (BTC2x-FLI)</h2>



<p><strong>BTC2x-FLI</strong>, released today, targets 2x exposure to WBTC price. That means that its price is expected to fluctuate double that of WBTC on average. In other words, if WBTC rises 10% in price, BTC2x-FLI is designed to go up by 20%.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We hope that <strong>BTC2x-FLI </strong>as an improved solution for DeFi investors is able to fill a niche in the market as large as its predecessor. ETH2x-FLI has seen explosive growth and achieved a market cap of more than $100M just seven weeks after launching.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>From a far-off dream to a powerful tool improving on traditional markets, the emergence of index tokens shows how much the DeFi ecosystem has evolved in the last year and a half. FLI is only possible thanks to a maturing DeFi ecosystem; its sophisticated strategy crafted into a simple user experience stands as a testament to what&#8217;s possible through our collaborative innovation as an industry. This is one of the many reasons why we’re so excited to be launching more indexes in the FLI series.

<p><em>The Flexible Leverage Index (FLI) lets you leverage a collateralized debt position in a safe and efficient way, by abstracting its management into a simple index, reproducible by a fully-collateralized ERC20 token built on Set Protocol.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="512" src="https://defipulse.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fli-pulse-1024x512.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8980" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fli-pulse-1024x512.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fli-pulse-300x150.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fli-pulse-768x384.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/03/fli-pulse.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The Flexible Leverage Index (FLI, pronounced “fly”) lets you <strong><em>leverage</em></strong> a collateralized debt without having to <strong><em>manage</em></strong> a collateralized debt. The design and methodology of FLI allows for the creation of a series of new indices with target leveraged exposure to different collateral assets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially <a href="https://pulseinc.medium.com/introducing-the-flexible-leverage-index-5ec90f2381ce">proposed by Pulse Inc in December 2020</a>, we’ve collaborated with Index Coop to produce FLI, an easier way for market participants to utilize leverage. Flexible Leverage Index enables market participants to take on leverage while minimizing the transaction costs and risks associated with maintaining collateralized debt.</p>



<h2><strong>Flexible Leverage Index (FLI) makes leverage effortless</strong></h2>



<p>If you’ve ever used leverage or legacy leveraged tokens, you probably already know how stressful the experience can be. It requires you to constantly be keeping an eye on the market and your position’s health ratio. The worry of liquidation can eat away at your attention during the day and rob you of your sleep at night. Not to mention, the expensive gas fees and slippage when you race to panic buy stablecoins to save yourself from liquidation penalties. It’s never a pleasant experience and in the end you’re left with the thought, “There has to be a better way!” And you aren’t wrong…<br><br><strong>FLI has several key advantages over Legacy Leveraged Tokens:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Zero slippage via composable entry and exit.</li><li>Unique Index algorithm reduces rebalancing needs by an order of magnitude.</li><li>Emergency deleveraging possible during Black Swan events for additional fund safety.</li></ul>



<h3><strong>The Ethereum Flexible Leverage Index</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://www.tokensets.com/portfolio/fli">The Ethereum Flexible Leverage Index (ETH2x-FLI)</a>, the first index in the Flexible Leverage Index series, provides decentralized target leveraged exposure to Ethereum (ETH). Built on Set Protocol, ETH2x-FLI is the first fully-collateralized leverage token which is redeemable for its underlying components: ETH and USDC. WBTC, LINK, and YFI are other potential candidates which we may consider for the FLI series in the future.</p>



<p><strong>Initial parameters for The Ethereum Flexible Leverage Index:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Underlying Asset: ETH</li><li>Target Leverage Ratio: 2</li><li>DeFi Lending Protocol: Compound</li><li>Maximum Leverage Ratio: 2.3</li><li>Minimum Leverage Ratio: 1.7</li><li>Recentering Speed: 5%</li></ul>



<p>As the first in the FLI series, ETH2x-FLI is the first of its kind on Ethereum: a fully collateralized leverage token, not derivative. It targets 2x leveraged exposure to ETH with a tolerance range to reduce the number of rebalances and thereby increase the gas efficiency for the end user. <a href="http://pulse.inc/flexible-leverage-index">You can view the FLI methodology on Pulse Inc</a>. You can learn more about the technical design of FLI and the mechanics behind leveraged tokens <a href="https://help.tokensets.com/en/collections/2545937-portfolios#leverage-tokens">here</a>.</p>



<p>Historically, leverage has played a big role in the DeFi ecosystem causing moments of extreme volatility which tested the limits of protocols. Aware of this precedent, FLI has been designed to handle volatility and even includes an emergency delevering mechanism for additional safety in the event of a black swan event. FLI’s fully-collateralized and redeemable also helps reduce risk and lends itself well to composability. As an ERC-20, ETH2x-FLI along with other future indices in the FLI series can be integrated into smart contracts for any number of use cases.</p>



<p><a href="http://Pulse.inc/">Pulse Inc</a> is dedicated to creating and maintaining indices for a decentralized world. Flexible Leverage Indices combine unique index algorithm designs with the latest DeFi innovations to provide market participants with a better alternative to the traditional means of taking on leverage. By providing a safer, more efficient leverage product, we hope to spare DeFi users the expense and tolling stress of maintaining leverage and that horrible feeling of getting liquidated.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The DeFi Pulse Index is a digital asset index designed to track tokens’ performance within the Decentralized Finance industry. The index is weighted based on the value of each token’s circulating supply. <strong>As part of our </strong><strong>commitment to the ongoing maintenance and development of the DeFi Pulse Index, we are transitioning from v0.1 of our methodology to </strong><a href="https://pulse.inc/"><strong>DeFi Pulse Index Construction, Version 0.2</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Version 0.2 introduces a change to the inclusion criteria that tokens must have a circulating supply minimum that is 7.5% or higher to ensure tokens have sufficient liquidity.</p>



<p>As outlined in v0.2 of its methodology, the DeFi Pulse Index is maintained in two phases: the Determination Phase and the Reconstitution Phase. The Determination Phase takes place during the third week of the month. During this phase, the circulating supply of each token currently included in DPI is determined. Any tokens eligible for addition or removal from DPI are also determined during this phase. Finally, new index weights, additions and deletions are incorporated into the index during the monthly Reconstitution Phase on the first business day of the month.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/07lr3Mkjtia8YKBoRCK7EuNm-z7c1LeZGef7gYtaGwHPVUu08o8uVwLrzN18lpvzIQWp96t-vQXeD3qjAU-05oo4M17GzpHOdR6Ja6dMtmGZurhwFiUXP9hhIHFLhjsp4q7H__0c" alt=""/></figure>



<p>DeFi tokens require adequate liquidity to be included in DPI. During our assessment, we found REP to have inconsistent liquidity. Liquidity is fractured across REP V1 and V2. As part of this month’s maintenance of DPI, REP will be removed from the DeFi Pulse Index as it does not meet the liquidity requirements for inclusion at this time. For information regarding inclusion criteria, see <a href="https://pulse.inc/">the DeFi Pulse Index Construction, Version 0.2.</a></p>



<p>In addition to the removal of REP, DPI has decreased its weighted allocations in MKR, YFI, KNC, REN, and LRC. DPI has increased its weighted allocation of COMP, SNX, AAVE, and BAL. <strong>DPI will be rebalanced as part of the Reconstitution Phase on December 1, 2020.</strong> You can also view more information about DPI and its underlying tokens on <a href="https://www.indexcoop.com/dpi">here</a>.</p>
