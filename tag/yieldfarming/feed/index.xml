										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>DeFi is a fast moving and highly competitive space. While DeFi may level the playing field by allowing anyone to participate, it still comes with risks and has a steep learning curve. When these factors are combined, it’s easy to see how the average user may feel left behind at times. Built by the team at Bloq, <a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5620418823&amp;iu=/22134506417">Vesper Finance</a> attempts to lower the barrier to entry for users by striking a balance between professionalism and DeFi’s dynamism in its products. Vesper’s first product — Vesper Grow, originally introduced as “Holding Pools” — offers users an easier way to passively earn a yield with their tokens, though with several innovations including a <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-modularity-48e64c810760">modular</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-multi-pool-3ea7f7325d39">multi-pool</a> design enabling pools to adapt and transition strategies behind the scenes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vesper’s ultimate goal is to create DeFi products with a set-and-forget type experience that adhere to Vesper’s stated <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vespers-core-principles-491c169778e1">Core Principles</a>: longevity, quality, trust, and community. Vesper’s roadmap is guided by these principles, featuring an economic model crafted to align Vesper stakeholders via VSP token incentives and community-created pools (More below.) <strong>Vesper emerges from beta on </strong><a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vesper-launch-date-february-17-2021-c08245cd3f18"><strong>February 17, 2021</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5620418823&amp;iu=/22134506417"><img loading="lazy" width="604" height="179" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ONoLln5Q.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8888" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ONoLln5Q.png 604w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ONoLln5Q-300x89.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px" /></a></figure>



<h2>Vesper Grow &#8211; adaptable pools with more than meets the eye</h2>



<p>In a nutshell, you deposit a token into a Vesper Grow pool, the pool then automatically puts your tokens to work in other DeFi protocols earning a passive return in the deposited token based on your chosen asset and risk tolerance. Vesper pools are scored and placed into two risk categories: <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/the-vesper-view-defining-conservative-vs-aggressive-ac5d44950384">Conservative and Aggressive Pools</a>. Risk scoring assesses the complexity of a pool’s underlying strategy, security of the protocols it interacts with, and the collateral ratios among other technical factors.</p>



<p>At first glance, Vesper may appear similar to other vault-like products, but upon further examination there is more than meets the eye. From a user’s perspective, a Vesper Grow pool represents a “front pool” that all tokens are deposited into. However, pool strategies can deploy tokens to any number of “back pool” strategies. We’ll cover more on how this multi-pool design makes Vesper’s products more adaptable in a bit.</p>



<p>Farmers will be happy to hear Vesper definitely learned a thing or two from last year’s yield farming craze. Vesper Grow cuts down the number of steps involved in traditional yield farming and has also been built with special features catering to farmers. For example, Vesper implemented <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612">EIP-2612</a> across all platform tokens which allows approvals to be made via off-chain signature. This is cheaper and faster, as it doesn’t require a separate transaction solely to approve interactions with these tokens. Another prime example is the sweeperc20 function which allows pools to swap ERC20s accumulated by front or back pools for more of the deposit asset so you won’t miss out on protocol rewards or future airdrops.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>What makes Vesper’s approach different?</h2>



<p>When you dive into Vesper, you’ll find there is hidden complexity behind the simple user experience.</p>



<h3>Highly modular, multi-pool design makes Vesper’s products versatile</h3>



<p>Vesper takes the concept of <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/rethinking-money-legos-for-sustainable-yield-strategies-8852d126750d">money legos</a> to heart. As previously mentioned, all Vesper pools have a single “front pool” that is actually made up of modular “back pool” strategies behind the scenes. Each strategy is like a money lego brick which can be swapped in and out without users needing to switch “front” pools. This allows Vesper’s products to be highly adaptable. In other words, Vesper users will never have to deal with pools being abandoned due to outdated strategies or what the Vesper refers to as “strategy fade,” establishing a set-and-forget user experience. Not to mention, this makes it easier for developers to utilize Vesper pools by seamlessly transitioning strategies without requiring smart contract upgrades and constant maintenance for integrations.</p>



<p>Vesper’s multi-pool design also enables earning strategies to be gradually upgraded over time. For example, a pool can start at 100% of an older strategy and keep slowly increasing its exposure to a newer strategy 5% at a time. This upgrade mechanism can be used to limit exposure to riskier strategies eliminating the need to cap deposits or ignore a strategy. Or, it can even allow the community to test out future “beta” pools proposed by community developers. It also enables a “market basket” of strategies, as there is no limit to concurrent strategies via this multi-pool design.</p>



<h3>Structured approach to code audits, testing and deployment</h3>



<p>“Aping” into smart contracts on a whim isn’t for everyone for a reason. Writing a complex smart contract system is hard. Getting it right on the first try is even harder. Users, especially inexperienced users, can all too often get burned by a mistake or bug found in complex smart contracts that “test in prod.”</p>



<p>Vesper takes a structured approach to testing and deploying new code. Vesper Finance has high standards for technical review. New code is audited several times, and potentially re-audited, throughout the formal software development process. Each new strategy or protocol integration Vesper deploys goes through a series of tests and safety checks. New code is run through off-mainnet tests, private mainnet tests, and then a public beta before ever reaching production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Vesper users have the freedom to set their own pace. <a href="https://app.vesperdev.net/">DeFi power users can opt-in to experimental pools via app.vesperdev.net if they wish to try out new strategies early.</a> Meanwhile, the average user can be confident that any new pool or strategy available in production (<a href="http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5620418823&amp;iu=/22134506417">app.vesper.finance</a>) has been through formal testing and auditing, whether it was developed by the Vesper team or a community member. (More on that below.) This process is not only about safety but it’s also about building trust with Vesper users and the wider DeFi community.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Vesper strives to foster community and drive long-term adoption</h2>



<p>Having a strong community is vital for any DeFi project to thrive. Community is fostered through trust and forming sustainable relationships. Vesper’s stated <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vespers-core-principles-491c169778e1">core principles</a><strong> </strong>are longevity, quality, trust, and community. By design, Vesper inherently vets for quality in its testing and deployment processes. Thorough testing combined with the set-and-forget user experience is likely to garner the trust of many DeFi users. This foundation of trust will be vital when moving forward on Vesper’s timeline towards community-created pools.</p>



<h3>Community-created Pools with Vesper Labs</h3>



<p>Vesper eventually plans to release Vesper Labs, allowing anyone to propose new strategies and pools. Developers whose strategies are adopted by the Vesper community are entitled to 5% of the fees generated for life — the same 5% that the Vesper team would get for pools <em>they</em> create. This generates a strong incentive for community developers to craft more and more innovative strategies. Vesper Labs improves accessibility by opening the door for anyone with talent and a clever strategy to contribute. And when paired with Vesper’s modular design, users enjoy a seamless experience while still benefiting from improved strategies.</p>



<h3>Vesper token incentives designed for sustainability and offer a clear path to decentralization</h3>



<p>The Vesper system has been designed from the start to create a sustainable economic model that ties the products in the Vesper Finance ecosystem together. VSP incentives aim to bootstrap the Vesper community by converting participants into protocol stakeholders. The system also encourages volunteer developers, cutting them in on revenue in a way that puts them on equal footing relative to the Vesper founders. This is key to <a href="https://docs.vesper.finance/community-participation-and-governance/governance">Vesper’s plan towards becoming fully decentralized</a>.</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8875" width="768" height="432" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1024x576.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-300x169.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-768x432.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1536x864.png 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-2048x1152.png 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/02/revenue-model-D3-keynote-light-background-2x_1-1568x882.png 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<p>As you can see, 95% of the fees generated by Vesper products are sent to the Treasury Box and swapped for VSP, creating natural demand for VSP based on the returns Vesper pools are able to generate for its users. These VSP tokens purchased by the Treasury Box are then distributed to those with VSP staked in the vVSP governance pool. The other 5% of fees goes to the developer who authored the strategy — either a member of the Vesper team or a member of the Vesper community. This revenue model keeps participants engaged and helps ensure the ecosystem’s longevity, funding such activities as engineering, marketing, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At launch, users can earn VSP tokens one of three ways: participating in Vesper’s pools, staking in the vVSP governance pool, and providing liquidity for particular VSP trading pairs. (See more about the <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/vespers-tokenomics-an-overview-f342ae5b613f">tokenomics, distribution, and emission schedules</a>.)</p>



<h2>Coming soon: Vesper Earn’s “Directed Pools”</h2>



<p>I couldn’t tell you all about Vesper without mentioning this future feature. While Vesper Grow allows users to deposit “Token A” and get more of “Token A,” Vesper Earn pools (previously discussed as “Directed Pools” at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paTBo4atcAo">BitGive De-Phi conference</a>) will allow users to deposit “Token A” and earn “Token B.”&nbsp; If you’ve been in DeFi long enough, you’ve probably fantasized about taking part of your stack, setting a strategy and turning on the auto-pilot. Vesper aspires to fulfill this dream for DeFi users. <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-vesper-earn-and-programmable-yield-afb2db24974a">Vesper Earn</a> pools take the yield they generate from user deposits and delivers what they call “programmable yield.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, you could set up a directed pool where your yield is used to purchase other tokens, passively diversifying your portfolio. You could even conceivably make a directed pool that splits your yield into other Vesper pools. There are so many different ways you could utilize directed pools. Imagine a pool that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKPm9PH4gXI#t=17m53s">donates its yield to charity</a>. All sorts of initiatives could use directed pools to bootstrap their funding. Or perhaps you like to treat yourself, you could create an income pool that sends you some stablecoin spending money each day. It will be really exciting to see these pools in action.</p>



<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>



<p>It’s easy to take for granted the progress DeFi has made over the past year alone. However, Vesper has clearly been taking notes. From the methodical testing procedure to the attention paid to mitigating “strategy fade” via its <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-modularity-48e64c810760">modular</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/vesperfinance/inside-vesper-multi-pool-3ea7f7325d39">multi-pool</a> design, Vesper has demonstrated their dedication to crafting a product model that addresses the concerns of its users and forming a sustainable community built on trust. Vesper seeks to foster a global community including support for eight different languages: English, Spanish, French, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Russian, and Turkish. It will certainly be exciting to follow Vesper as it proceeds along its roadmap towards Community-created and Earn Pools.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Alpha Homora was a DeFi product born out of practicality. Those familiar with DeFi can tell you that users will go to extraordinary lengths when they spot an opportunity. This proved to be especially true as the yield farming craze reached a fever pitch in 2020 when users would combine various lending protocols to leverage yield farming opportunities. It wasn’t long before <a href="https://alphafinance.io/">Alpha Finance Lab</a> spotted this gap in the market and created Alpha Homora to give users a better way to yield farm with leverage more efficiently while also attempting to minimize the risks involved.</p>



<p>Alpha Homora V2 builds on the popular Alpha Homora V1 yield farming product, supporting more AMM protocols, including Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap, allowing yield farmers to borrow various assets in addition to ETH, and enabling leverage of up to 9x leverage thanks to new partnerships.<strong> </strong><a href="https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/"><strong>Alpha Homora V2</strong></a><strong> is set to launch on Feb 1st.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-1024x549.png" alt="" class="wp-image-8843" width="768" height="412" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-1024x549.png 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-300x161.png 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb-768x411.png 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2021/01/alpha-social-thumb.png 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure></div>



<h2>How does leveraged yield farming work?</h2>



<p>Manually yield farming with leverage required you to take out and manage loans across several lending platforms in what amounted to a nerve-wrecking position that could be extremely hard to ‘unwind’. Using <a href="https://homora-v2.alphafinance.io/">Alpha Homora V2</a> is a lot simpler and helps minimize the risks involved (though <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/risk">nothing is risk-free</a>). First, you select a supported liquidity pool from popular exchanges like SushiSwap, Uniswap, Balancer, and Curve that are on Alpha Homora v2 and then supply either or both of the tokens to your desired pool. For example, if you choose the SushiSwap&#8217;s ETH/USDC pool that is on Alpha Homora V2 you can provide ETH, USDC, or both. Note, you don’t need to have equal value of both tokens in order to yield farm with Alpha Homora V2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, you’ll decide whether or not you want to use leverage (which goes up to 9x for selected pools). And then, follow the prompts to confirm and submit your transaction and <em>viola </em>Alpha Homora automagically handles the rest. Users can borrow multiple assets, re-leverage, and deleverage their positions easily in just a few clicks. Compared to doing this process by hand, Alpha Homora can <em>feel like magic.</em> It’s easy to see where the name comes from.</p>



<h1>What’s new in Alpha Homora V2?</h1>



<p>Strong partnerships have shaped the design of Alpha Homora V2. Many of you may have noticed that V2 allows yield farmers to take advantage of significantly more leverage than its predecessor. Behind the scenes, Alpha Homora V2 utilizes CREAM V2’s liquidity to take on leverage for its users. Sometimes referred to as The Iron Bank, CREAM V2 allows whitelisted partner protocols like Alpha Homora V2 to take out loans with less collateral requirements. This results in more leverage for Alpha Homora’s yield farmers and higher interest rates for CREAM V2 users.<br></p>



<p>Alpha Finance Labs worked closely with its partners to enable leveraged yield farming of liquidity pools on Curve, Balancer, SushiSwap, and Uniswap. And in an effort to help strengthen its partners’ communities, Alpha Homora V2 will not automatically sell and reinvest the farmed tokens. <strong>At launch, Alpha Homora V2 will feature the following leveraged farming pools:</strong></p>



<p><strong>New leveraged pools:</strong></p>



<ul><li>Curve’s 3pool (USDT, USDC, DAI)</li><li>Balancer’s PERP/USDC</li></ul>



<p><strong>Pools migrated from V1:</strong></p>



<ul><li>SushiSwap’s ETH/SUSHI</li><li>Uniswap’s ETH/UNI</li></ul>



<p>In a nutshell, farmers will be able to leverage USDT, USDC, DAI, and ETH to farm CRV, PERP, or SUSHI tokens with up to 9x leverage. On the flipside, lenders will be able to lend ETH, USDT, USDC, and DAI on day one to start earning interest. The plan is to continue to add even more new pools and migrate more pools from V1 over time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those curious, be sure to check out these fantastic posts written by the Alpha Finance team that walks you through Alpha Homora V2 from the perspective of <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-in-yield-farmers-perspectives/">yield farmers</a> and <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/alpha-homora-v2-in-lenders-perspectives/">lenders</a>. Alpha Homora is also offering additional yield in the form of ALPHA rewards for both farmers. See <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/liquidity-mining-part-2a">here</a> for more information.</p>



<h2>Migrating to V2</h2>



<p>To ensure a smooth transition, ALPHA rewards will continue for a limited time for those liquidity mining on Alpha Homora V1. Although farmers should be aware that leveraged positions on Alpha Homora v2 will get more rewards compared to those on V1. This creates an incentive to migrate sooner rather than later. Here’s <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/72-hour-countdown/">a step-by-step guide</a> for those looking to migrate.</p>



<h2>What is ibETHv2?</h2>



<p>When you lend out an asset on Alpha Homora, you receive the corresponding ibToken or interest bearing token. ibETHv2 is an interest-bearing ETH token you receive when lending ETH to Alpha Homora V2. Alpha Homora typically has competitive yields for ETH due to the high demand from its leverage yield farming pools. Alpha Finance Lab also runs a <a href="https://alphafinancelab.gitbook.io/alpha-homora/trading-volume-mining-part-2b">Trading Volume Mining</a> program which rewards users for supplying liquidity to ibETH/ALPHA and ibETHv2/ALPHA pools.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/o7JpNF2vwiZxUlXbPbEtUtMMlbqUwQM-KpKE5OSCqCYH0jEBrzXPKlkjlCp1E7fk5JD8rQx5sGaQqQaShoaL1BF8_FuqNWS_yV7z5qzmfbBNjFw_L6otv5Yzlfeo2yw2RYBZgEsm" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The ibETHv2/ALPHA pool on SushiSwap <a href="https://blog.alphafinance.io/72-hour-countdown/">goes live on Feb 3rd</a>. Liquidity providers of this pool will receive ALPHA rewards as well as SUSHI tokens from SushiSwap’s Onsen program. Rewards from Alpha Finance’s Trading Volume Mining program will be reflected in the form of trading fees APY when you remove liquidity (not airdropped to your wallet). Those providing liquidity to the ibETH/ALPHA pool on Uniswap will still receive rewards until Feb 3rd, 1pm UTC.</p>



<h1>Closing Thoughts</h1>



<p>Alpha Finance Lab’s initial release of Alpha Homora was well-received by the DeFi community given the immediate utility it provided to yield farmers. Alpha Homora V2 built on this popular platform to provide more utility for its users and value for its partner protocols. Key partnerships like the utilization of CREAM V2’s Iron Bank will allow Alpha Homora V2’s users to achieve higher levels of capital efficiency. It’s undeniable we’ve entered a new era in DeFi where partnerships can give you an edge more now than ever. So it will be very interesting to see how such a deep protocol level partnership influences the future growth of both platforms. Regardless of how things pan out, Alpha Homora V2 users will reap the benefits in the meantime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Yield farming allows projects to bootstrap their communities through incentives created by distributing their protocol’s token, essentially killing two birds with one stone. While these farming opportunities are open to all participants, making the most of these opportunities requires a certain amount of capital and expertise. And nowadays, yield farming has practically become a full-time job.</p>



<p>Harvest Finance set out to make life easier for farmers big and small. It allows users to farm as a collective to achieve the best risk-adjusted rate for a given asset. Launched on September 1st, 2020 in the midst of the yield farming craze with the slogan, “Bread for the People”, <a href="https://harvest.finance/">Harvest Finance</a> has gone on to become one of the largest yield aggregators with a vibrant community from all over the world. With farming having become the new norm, using a yield aggregator like Harvest Finance is like using a tractor instead of a manual plow; it’ll take less effort and ultimately be more efficient.</p>



<h2>Farming at Scale with Harvest Finance</h2>



<p>If you’re new to farming, it seems rather simple. Typically, you deposit a token, stablecoin, or liquidity pool token into a farm to earn tokens at a variable APR. You could simply deposit your assets and come back later to harvest your yield, but you’d be missing out. Manually harvesting and compounding your yields to achieve a higher APY means covering all the gas costs involved. For smaller farmers, the gas costs involved in this process can really start to eat into your returns. Not to mention, you’d need to meticulously calculate and track your APY in order to make sure it was even worth your time or the opportunity cost.</p>



<p>When a user deposits assets into Harvest to farm, they receive fTokens (i.e. fUSDC) which represent a yield-bearing version of the asset. fTokens can be redeemed for the underlying asset at any time. Depositors receive 70% of the profits generated from farming via Harvest as well as FARM token rewards. The remaining 30% is sent to a protocol token buyback and profit sharing program, but more on that later. As the first yield aggregator to adopt a performance-based fee structure, Harvest never charged a withdraw fee as others did. I know what you’re thinking: Why would I give up 30% of my profits when I can farm by myself?</p>



<p>Farming as a collective comes with its advantages compared to going it alone. It can be helpful to think of it as “farming at scale” to reduce operational costs and improve efficiency. If you opted to farm with Harvest Finance in the scenario above, your deposit would automatically compound for a higher APY when possible. Best of all, Harvest covers the gas costs associated with executing farming strategies and compounding deposits. The advantages of Harvest’s collective farming and FARM token design don’t end there though.</p>



<h3>FARM token aligns stakeholders of the Harvest Cooperative</h3>



<p>The goal of the Harvest Cooperative is to become the world’s largest farming cooperative making the latest yield farming techniques accessible to anyone, even those who are currently underbanked. In order to achieve this goal, the farmers of the Harvest Cooperative pool together resources to earn profits and create additional utility and value for its community of Harvest stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the heart of the Harvest Cooperative is Harvest’s FARM token which incentivizes participation, governs Harvest Finance, and allows users to benefit from the performance of the platform. At launch, FARM started with an initial supply of 0. Harvest Finance bootstrapped its community completely by offering FARM token rewards to depositors and liquidity providers. Only 690,420 FARM will be minted over 4 years with a current emission rate of 4.4% per week. At the time of writing, roughly 50% of FARM tokens have been minted so far. FARM tokens are distributed as follows: 70% of FARM tokens go to depositors and liquidity pool providers, 10% of tokens are vested over 4 years to the Operational Treasury to pay for additional development and promotion, and finally 20% are vested over 4 years to the Development Team.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/H1p0SHH5s-9KmMUH4gDeF9w8yCqiNUNQzmpZGzpi5t8G4JalzDe6hdhUK9jk8CBhafbgqyrasyWkHZ7mQ4_hdYKZfGA-uXMtyZHe2Ewl-oYfZ2JaJ62axGOef2RMRDKOFxfw0hhl" alt=""/></figure>



<h4>FARM Buybacks and Profit Sharing Pool</h4>



<p>As previously mentioned, 30% of all the profits generated by Harvest are converted to USDC and used to buy FARM tokens off the market. These FARM tokens are then distributed to Harvest Cooperative members with FARM tokens staked in Harvest’s Profit Sharing Pool. FARM buybacks create natural demand for FARM and are fueled purely by how much profit Harvest is able to generate for its users. The idea is that everyone in the Harvest Cooperative from farmers earning token incentives to the initiatives funded by the Operational Treasury benefit when the value of FARM increases further aligning the different Harvest stakeholders.</p>



<h3>Harvest Cooperative is able to steer growth and adoption together</h3>



<p>The Harvest Cooperative is incentivized to make changes that help the platform grow. Unlike an individual farmer, the Harvest Cooperative has a budget of sorts which it can use to collectively pay for things. FARM holders can create and vote on proposals for new strategies, protocol changes, or even initiatives to be funded by the Operational Treasury. This allows the Harvest Cooperative to stay on top of the latest yield farming strategies. Harvest was the first yield aggregator to release a farming strategy for SWRV, UNI, and Idle Finance. The treasury can also be used to incentivize users to participate in more profitable farms for the Cooperative. The Harvest community also makes use of the treasury to fund programs like creativity contests, bounties programs, and prizes for developer challenges which we’ll cover a bit more later on.</p>



<h3>Farming as a collective offers additional forms of risk mitigation</h3>



<p>Not only can pooling resources fund the development of new strategies, it also can be used to make farming <a href="https://farm.chainwiki.dev/en/security">more sustainable through test suites</a>, ongoing <a href="https://github.com/harvest-finance/harvest/tree/master/audits">audits</a> and <a href="https://immunefi.com/bounty/harvest/">security bug bounties</a>.</p>



<h4>GRAIN reparations after USDC/USDT vaults exploited</h4>



<p>On October 26, 2020, an attacker was able to use a flash loan to <a href="https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-flashloan-economic-attack-post-mortem-3cf900d65217">steal 12.5% of funds from Harvest&#8217;s USDC and USDT vaults via an exploit</a>, resulting in a shared loss of $33.8M. The Harvest Community <a href="https://snapshot.page/#/farm/proposal/QmYF62qGaqyHAXt88Hmxise6CFaSWxnTmi5VedZ3VX8Zy2">voted to provide reparations to those affected by the exploit</a> in the form of an <a href="https://medium.com/harvest-finance/announcing-the-grain-claims-portal-20dd12c4f631">IOU token known as GRAIN</a>. Those affected were able to<a href="https://claim.harvest.finance/"> claim their share</a> of the $2.48M returned by the attacker as well as GRAIN tokens. Each week 0.5% of the total FARM emissions are sent to reparation pools, GRAIN buyback and FARM/GRAIN liquidity pool, up to the amount lost in the attack. Creating an incentivized FARM/GRAIN pool creates the liquidity necessary to support the buyback program and allows GRAIN holders to receive more FARM rewards for staking their liquidity as well. For those curious, <a href="https://duneanalytics.com/0xBoxer/-grain">this dashboard</a> has some interesting stats regarding the amount of GRAIN claimed. Solo farmers are often forced to accept losses due to attacks, but as you can see collective farming with an on-going revenue stream offers potential ways to remedy situations such as this.</p>



<h2>Harvest Cooperative has a strong sense of identity</h2>



<p>Even though Harvest community members are from all around the world (with a notable presence in the Chinese DeFi community), Harvest Cooperative has a strong identity and incentive structure that is welcoming of all. Harvest has previously affirmed their belief that financial inclusion is important for everyone, especially the unbanked and the underbanked. An understated benefit of farming together is that Harvest Cooperative is able express their values and give back to the community as a collective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the start, Harvest Finance community has had an appreciation for memes as made evident by their Farmer Chad logo. Anyone who keeps up with DeFi on Twitter has probably seen countless memes of Farmer Chad. This is no coincidence; In the spirit of its #BreadForThePeople slogan, Harvest frequently hosts creativity contests where users are rewarded for their creative contributions to Harvest Cooperative. <a href="https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-finance-farm-arts-creativity-contest-round-4-festive-edition-3ba3e5843da2">The most recent Creativity Competition</a>’s theme is “Celebrating the Festive Season”. The cool part about these competitions is that it allows those without the capital necessary to farm to benefit from Harvest Cooperative’s success.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-1024x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="wp-image-8759" width="512" height="512" srcset="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-1024x1024.jpeg 1024w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-300x300.jpeg 300w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-150x150.jpeg 150w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-768x768.jpeg 768w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-2048x2048.jpeg 2048w, ./../../../wp-content/uploads/2020/12/farmer-chad-snow1-1-1568x1568.jpeg 1568w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /><figcaption>Artwork from Harvest community member <a href="https://twitter.com/stulmtuno4273/status/1330292559277682693/photo/3">Sumire</a></figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Developers will also find they are warmly welcomed in the Harvest community. Harvest hosts developer contests and has <a href="https://gitcoin.co/issue/harvest-finance/harvest/15/100024325">bounty programs</a> to reward developers who want to contribute to the Harvest Finance ecosystem. For those interested, head over to the <a href="https://discord.gg/ayKVET52z6">Harvest Discord</a>’s #dev channel and introduce yourself.</p>



<p>The Harvest Cooperative also expresses their support for the wider community by giving back to programs like Gitcoin Grants which supports future builders. Harvest <a href="https://harvestfinance.medium.com/week-14-updates-building-today-funding-the-builders-of-tomorrow-74c5ea8575f6">announced on December 1, 2020</a> that it would be partnering with Gitcoin to launch a $500k grant matching pool in the latest Gitcoin Grants Round 8.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Partnerships with Harvest Cooperative</h2>



<p>Harvest also likes to drive engagement through community partnerships and collaborations that present unique opportunities for Harvest Cooperative members to earn rewards in the form of tokens, NFTs, and more. For example, Harvest <a href="https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-apy-vision-partnership-be80f577b18?source=collection_home---6------4-----------------------">will be giving away a total of 80 APYCHADPRO NFTs</a> that grants 90 days of access to the PRO edition of liquidity pool tracker APY.vision to Harvest Cooperative members staking in the Uniswap FARM/USDC liquidity pool. Another example being 88mph’s <a href="https://medium.com/88mphapp/88mph-x-harvest-degen-challenge-over-6k-in-prizes-94979f3a5fa9">recently announced</a> 2-week ‘Degen Challenge’ in collaboration with Harvest which encourages participants to build something creative combining 88mph’s fixed-yield pools or floating-rate bonds with Harvest’s vaults. Last but not least, Harvest <a href="https://badgerdao.medium.com/harvest-finance-joins-the-league-of-badger-builders-551031da69a1">collaborated with Bitcoin-focused BadgerDAO</a> to help launch Badger DAO’s Harvest SuperSett vault. Harvest community members <a href="https://twitter.com/BadgerDAO/status/1334921775013109761">were also eligible to receive</a> at least 20 BADGER during the launch of Badger token.</p>



<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>



<p>With yield farming practically being a full-time job, Harvest Finance has quickly become one of the leading yield aggregators in DeFi. It’s effective use of incentive structures aims to create a positive feedback loop that benefits all stakeholders of the Harvest Cooperative, ultimately forming a strong sense of community.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As any yield farmer can tell you, chasing higher yields can be a risky endeavour and in most cases is not a sustainable strategy for the average user. It’s all too easy to get caught up in hype and be blinded by outrageous yields. If you aren’t careful or are simply unaware of risks such as hidden backdoors in unaudited smart contracts, it becomes increasingly possible that you could get burned. Getting exploited, “rug pulled”, and otherwise losing your investment is devastating. This sort of risk is intolerable for most investors. Although, that doesn’t mean those same investors aren’t out to maximize their yields; They simply want to strike the right balance of risk versus reward. This is exactly what <a href="https://www.rari.capital/">Rari Capital</a> aims to offer users: a way to maximize DeFi returns while minimizing risks. <strong>Rari Capital V2, launching October 20th, 2020, has even more to offer than its predecessor.<br></strong><br>Rari Capital is a robo-advisor for DeFi which optimizes for the highest possible yield. Rari Capital&#8217;s ‘DeRisking as a Service’ approach is largely what sets them apart from the pack. Armed with the experience of having co-founded Ambo (later acquired by MyCrypto), the Rari team has experienced first-hand the value of earning the community’s trust. So when they set out to build a protocol that anyone can use to maximize returns in DeFi, risk management and transparency were top priorities. If you haven’t already, we recommend checking out <a href="https://defipulse.com/blog/rari-capital/">our coverage of Rari Capital V1’s guarded launch</a>.<br><br>The Rari team has been busy since we last checked in with them developing features and integrations, perfecting new strategies, and preparing for the<strong> </strong>launch of Rari Capital V2.</p>



<h2>Goodbye deposit limits</h2>



<p>As part of its guarded launch, Rari V1 launched with deposit limits designed to manage risks and grow the platform in a controlled manner. Thorough <a href="https://www.rari.capital/risks.html">risk assessment</a> for integrations and transparency have also been core components of Rari’s guarded launch allowing the team to gradually increase the deposit limits over time. Rari is <a href="https://quantstamp.com/blog/chasing-yield-with-defi-aggregators">working with Quantstamp</a> on several security reviews. <strong>Rari Capital has since removed deposit limits. </strong></p>



<h2>New integrations enable higher yields</h2>



<p>Since the launch of Rari Capital V1, <a href="https://medium.com/rari-capital/rari-capital-integrates-aave-fa2574a15a3a">Aave</a> and mStable have been integrated into the protocol. It doesn’t stop there though; Rari Capital V2 goes beyond lending protocols and stablecoin swaps to achieve higher returns for its users. In the past few weeks, Rari’s theoretical APY has spiked as high as 109%, thanks in part to the recent mStable integration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/z6Fuc0bQhXYIz75pRi-w5hIfH5A4NRLHJm-sqAJ6Aa95BydKOwv5zZ0fjnEQu1vyE4_Ik0wwAzpJuRDw8jXTbGLAeofiYSL-G2wo1dKFN7lHI0piviCrcaXq0gLc4WpgN4WIyBOj" alt=""/></figure>



<p><br>The Rari team continues to explore new integrations to optimize pool strategies including yEarn and <a href="https://medium.com/rari-capital/rari-capital-x-synthetix-48413e50a56e">Synthetix</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>3 Pools with Unique Strategies</h2>



<p>Rari is introducing 3 pools with strategies that cater to different risk appetites. The Rari team is also working on even more new strategies that will be able to weather any crypto market conditions generating sustainable yields.</p>



<p><strong>Rari Stable Pool (RSPT)</strong></p>



<p>This pool caters to the risk-averse investor seeking to maximize their USD-based returns with caution, making use of exclusively audited smart contracts in its strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Rari Yield Pool (RYPT)</strong></p>



<p>Are you willing to risk it for the biscuit as they say? This pool will always have the highest yield utilizing anything from unaudited smart contracts to even leverage in order to maximize your returns at all costs. You can think of this pool as: higher risk, higher reward.</p>



<p><strong>Rari ETH Pool (REPT)</strong></p>



<p>If you’re the type of person that measures their net worth in ETH, this pool is for you. The Rari ETH Pool aims to provide consistent returns based in ETH.</p>



<h2>Rari Governance&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The upgrade to version 2.0 also introduces decentralized governance to Rari Capital via Rari Governance Tokens (RGT). RGT holders will decide how to govern the protocol and the Rari Treasury, determining new protocols integrations, pool parameters, and risk parameters. RGT can be staked to receive fee discounts from the Rari Protocol, a feature powered by Chainlink. Rari Capital V2 is designed so that 70% of all protocol revenue will be used to buy and burn RGT, reducing the total supply.</p>



<h3>Passthrough Governance</h3>



<p>Rari’s governance has a cool feature called ‘Passthrough Governance’ where if a pool begins to accumulate tokens such as COMP or BAL, RGT holders can use these tokens to engage in their respective governance systems. It’s a practical solution that mitigates the current shortcoming found in other protocols where users must sacrifice the ability to engage with token governance in order to utilize an automated strategy. As Rari continues to integrate more and more protocols, this feature may become more important over time. Some protocols issue rewards for participating in governance which means this feature could potentially be used as part of a yield generating strategy at some point in the future.</p>



<h3>Liquidity Mining</h3>



<p>87.50% of RGT will be distributed over a 60 day period via a liquidity mining program set to start on October 20th, 2020 with the launch of Rari Capital V2. The remaining RGT is reserved for the Rari team and is subject to a vesting schedule. <strong>For full details, we recommend reading </strong><a href="https://medium.com/rari-capital/announcing-rgt-the-long-term-yield-token-b2593502a7f3"><strong>the RGT announcement post</strong></a><strong>. It’s worth noting that while the distribution will last 60 days nearly half of the tokens will be distributed in the first 15 days. Additionally, “there is a ‘burn’ as a user when you attempt to transfer your $RGT before the 60-day distribution schedule is expired.”</strong></p>



<h2>Concluding Thoughts</h2>



<p>Rari Capital V2 further cements its product-market fit by offering more to users of any risk appetite. Whether you’re looking to earn risk-minimized returns on idle ETH or stablecoins or you’d rather chase the highest yields, Rari Capital’s sophisticated robo-advisor can be an effective tool in your arsenal. And it’s safe to expect more pools and integrations on the horizon, especially with the introduction of community governance. It’ll also be curious to see how the community chooses to govern the protocol and in what ways they may evolve each strategy.</p>



<p><strong>Rari Capital V2 is set to launch on October 20th, 2020</strong>. Be sure to check it out at <a href="https://app.rari.capital/">Rari Capital</a> when the time comes and <a href="https://twitter.com/Raricapital">follow them on Twitter</a> in the meantime to hear the latest regarding the launch of V2.</p>



<p><strong><em>Disclosure: This post is part a promotional series; We’ve partnered with Rari Capital to help educate and inform the community about the launch of Rari Capital V2.

					<description><![CDATA[Since the introduction of yield farming two months ago, DeFi has been growing at breakneck speed. Total Value Locked (TVL)...]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Since the introduction of yield farming two months ago, DeFi has been growing at breakneck speed. Total Value Locked (TVL) has <a href="https://defipulse.com/">increased 5.6X and reached its all-time high of $6.77B</a>. New protocols, platforms, and new investment opportunities are launched week after week, making it hard to keep up even for the most sophisticated users in the space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This exponential growth has made it increasingly complex for users to efficiently select the best yield farming opportunities while reducing their exposure to risks. And it is even harder for inexperienced users who are looking to have exposure to DeFi protocols. These users don&#8217;t know where to start due to the complexity of these systems, and the lack of a single product that can help them make informed decisions without diving into multiple Twitter threads, blog posts, Discord groups, and complicated platforms.</p>



<p>Here is where <a href="https://delphi.akropolis.io/summary">Delphi</a> comes in.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is Delphi?</strong></h2>



<p>Delphi is an easy to use platform that allows users to automate their DeFi lives. Their platform offers curated access to different yield farming opportunities across DeFi, by providing non-technical users with a clean and simple UI to help them take advantage of them.</p>



<p>Through its platform, users have access to different investment options depending on their risk appetite. These options are presented as Savings, Investments, DCA (dollar-cost averaging), and Staking. Delphi is built by the Akropolis team and is the second product after <a href="https://sparta.akropolis.io/">Sparta</a> built on the <a href="https://github.com/akropolisio/akropolisOS">AkropolisOS</a>.</p>



<p>Only the Savings option is available, but the Investments, DCA, and Staking options will soon go live, as well. For a full view of their releases schedule, you can <a href="https://www.notion.so/b390a85d87124796b0b008b20e6ab38e?v=387bc54a16e34bf2b8f7328b839eebc2">check out Akropolis&#8217;s roadmap here.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>The two most exciting options that can be accessed through Delphi are the &#8220;Savings account,&#8221; and “DCA” options:</p>



<h3><strong>Savings account</strong></h3>



<p>The Savings account option provides users with a value proposition similar to that of traditional finance products, in which users can access products that offer predictable returns at low costs. The key difference here is that Delphi manages allocations across a wide array of stable coin DeFi pools in different protocols to take advantage of yield farming opportunities. In this way, Delphi offers higher APYs, while canceling volatility and exposure to impermanent loss.</p>



<h2><strong>DCA&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The DCA option brings a much-needed feature to the DeFi space that has been traditionally offered by centralized exchanges: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">dollar-cost averaging</a>. DCA gives users a straightforward way to gain exposure to assets by reducing the impact of volatility on the overall purchases.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How does Delphi work?</strong></h2>



<p>Delphi seeks to lower the barrier to entry for the least experienced DeFi users and be a compelling tool for experienced users at the same time. To achieve that, it offers a straightforward and intuitive interface. The “Savings” &amp; Staking” options will be the first to go live on August 24th. So we will focus on the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option and on how to leverage it to make the most out of your investments.</p>



<ol><li>First, remember that to use the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option, you must own stablecoins such as DAI, USDC, or sUSD.</li><li>Once you have stable coins in your wallet, go to the <a href="https://delphi.akropolis.io/">Delphi website</a>, click on the right-hand side top corner on the &#8220;App&#8221; button, and connect your wallet when the pop up requests you to do so.</li><li>Once your wallet is connected, you&#8217;ll be ready to start using the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option.</li><li>When clicking on the &#8220;Savings&#8221; option, you will select among one of five pools in which to allocate your stablecoins and create your savings account. Starting tomorrow, you will be able to pick among any of the following pools:<ul><li>Compound DAI pool</li><li>Compound USDC pool</li><li>sUSD Curve pool</li><li>Y Curve</li><li>bUSD Curve pool</li></ul></li></ol>



<p>Pools have an option called &#8220;View Pool Details,&#8221; where you can click to find out the details about each pool and compare them to decide in which one to invest your savings. &#8220;View Pool Details&#8221; shows the total liquidity and asset weight, daily volume, gas costs, and, most importantly, the pools&#8217; APY and the approximate weekly rewards that will be received in each of the tokens awarded in each pool.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/XfWoxhKABSnqAXAm3oYLetwE8qZ1_1Vf25Nv4Rw_Ux4mplgdxKJIxXLpkpPJUHyvvdAzRV7s8sPYpUE8BNwKAHb3AxCeBFRB3GmOEEiuNTGkg-tfhI83H8nLpC7DLXud9jhxrGLJ" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Once you make up your mind, you can invest your savings in a single pool by clicking on the &#8220;Allocate&#8221; option in each pool. But you can also diversify among two, three or more pools by clicking on the &#8220;Allocate&#8221; option on the bottom right-hand corner.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/wXZBLNX8tVNhz81dJjqiMciJFOaD7PWBw4DIHMzdlChYsIXnJsqZ8Q2dmhbbm4MgmRvx2ESfZbWx0yhfzv1FkSFSSkmVirl7ZCF1OPzZjKLd31bsLVvbd3ts4vpQjobdDOL5ndzy" alt=""/></figure>



<p>The &#8220;Allocate&#8221; option is one of the coolest features of the Delphi &#8220;Savings&#8221; option. It allows you to diversify your savings by investing in more than one pool by performing one single transaction, at lower costs than making a separate investment in each pool by accessing different protocols.</p>



<p>As for the Staking, it’s a simple supply of liquidity to the AKRO-only pool at the moment. In the future, this section will be expanded &amp; include Akropolis governance pools for Akropolis products.</p>



<p><strong>Bonus (coming soon): </strong>with Delphi, you can also rebalance your allocation between pools in one single transaction.</p>



<p>Finally, once you have allocated your savings in one or more pools, you can track all of your investments by clicking on the &#8220;My Summary&#8221; option, which allows you to track all of your pools, APYs &amp; harvest in one place.</p>



<h2><strong>Delphi Governance</strong></h2>



<p>The Delphi platform will be governed by holders of the ADEL governance token, which will be minted over six months after its mainnet launch. In a very similar fashion to YFI, ADEL will not have a pre-sale or pre-mine. It will only be earnt through liquidity provision of stablecoins, AKRO, and other selected tokens and active governance participation, and just 5% will be reserved for development, audits &amp; other costs.</p>



<p>The most important parameters will be the following:</p>



<ul><li>ADEL is not just a governance token — it will have a shared claim on Delphi&#8217;s future fees (exit/entry fees, performance fees, exchange referral fees, etc.).</li><li>60,000,000 ADEL will be minted as fixed supply and distributed linearly over six months. Community governance will have the option to amend the ADEL monetary policy to introduce inflation/deflation/elasticity of supply.</li><li>95% goes to active users/LPs, including community rewards [unlocked from week 2].</li><li>5% goes to development, maintenance, and audit.</li><li>A product governance DAO will be created before or shortly after full mainnet launch.</li></ul>

<h2><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong></h2>



<p>As DeFi continues to grow exponentially and more protocols and platforms continue to launch weekly, complexity across the space will also increase. Even the most sophisticated users will start struggling to keep track of all the different investment opportunities and new systems in this scenario. This is where platforms such as Delphi come in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By solving all the complexities in the background and providing a clean UI for any user to easily invest, rebalance, and monitor their allocations, Delphi provides a very compelling value proposition that can make any user comfortable with interacting with DeFi.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It is also exciting that the governance token distribution that Delphi will pursue puts the users of the protocol first and will allocate 95% of all minted tokens to the community.</p>
