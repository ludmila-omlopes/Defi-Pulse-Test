The result sent chain reaction rippling through DeFi in an event many will likely come to refer to as Black Thursday. DeFi users rushed to make transactions like trading on DEXes, paying off debts, bolstering collateral ratio, etc. The increased activity led to record-setting high gas prices at times exceeding 200 gwei. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with how gas prices work, think of it as an auction for the limited space in each block. Users desperate to get their transaction through start to outbid each other to get their transactions completed in a timely manner. And then, the ensuing &#8220;bidding wars&#8221; drive up gas prices and subsequently cause low-priced transactions to be stuck until things settle down. <strong><em>The bottom line is that the increased volume put a lot of stress on DeFi smart contracts along with the entire Ethereum network.<\/em> <\/strong>So we&#8217;ve decided to put together this status update to provide context for those unaware who may panic at the sight of the charts lately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Don&#8217;t panic. All is not lost and DeFi endured the test.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s worth taking a moment to say: <em>there are safety measures in place for a reason.<\/em> When you install fire alarms and safety systems you hope you never need to use them, but know that there could always come a day when you have to. And if your home catches on fire, you don&#8217;t abandon the concept of living in homes altogether. You rebuild your home and this time you build it bit safer and better overall. We, as a community, have been tested before and have only grown stronger for these trials. A decentralized financial market is a market worth fighting for and the truth is&#8230; DeFi remains one of the most exciting and innovative spaces on this planet and will only continue to grow and evolve despite the occasional bump in the road.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>High levels of network congestion affected the entire Ethereum network so we&#8217;ll only be addressing some of the more notable ways DeFi projects were affected by recent events.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Maker<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the exact issue is still <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.makerdao.com\/recent-market-activity-and-next-steps\/\">under investigation<\/a>, the dramatic increase in gas prices caused Maker&#8217;s price feed oracle to remain stuck at ~$166 despite the market dipping almost 15% lower at times. High gas prices also affected Keeper bots, preventing many from liquidating undercollateralized loans. Unfortunately, some Keepers were able to bid on and purchase collateral ETH for 0 DAI. And, many Vault owners reported 100% of their collateral being liquidated. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Maker community call was held to determine the best plan of action. Maker put out <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.makerdao.com\/recent-market-activity-and-next-steps\/\">a blog post<\/a> addressing the situation and proposed various parameters which could be adjusted to prevent further issues. MKR holders have since <a href=\"https:\/\/vote.makerdao.com\/executive-proposal\/adjust-multiple-risk-parameters\">approved changes<\/a> including lowering debt ceilings, lowering stability fees, changing auction parameters to allow keepers additional time and limit the total number of auctions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the approved parameter changes was delaying the Debt Auction, designed to cover the +$4M in remaining system debt, in an attempt to give the community more time to prepare.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MKR Debt Auction<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Maker is designed with a pool of DAI called the <em>Maker Buffer<\/em> reserved to cover debts in situations like this<em>.<\/em> However, the Maker Buffer was unable to cover the deficit caused by the tremendous amount of liquidations. As stated in its\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/makerdao.com\/en\/whitepaper\/\">whitepaper<\/a>, the Maker Protocol will now trigger a Debt Auction where MKR is minted and sold for DAI to re-collateralize the system. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are the details for the auction according to<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.makerdao.com\/mkr-debt-auction-announcement-and-details\/\"> MakerDAO&#8217;s blog<\/a>: <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Start time: March 19, 6:25 am ET (March 19, 10:25 am UTC)<\/li><li> MKR will be auctioned off in lots for 50,000 Dai<\/li><li>According to parameters of the Maker Protocol as determined by governance, the auction works as in the following example:<ul><li>The protocol offers a Keeper (bidder) a lot of 250 MKR for 50,000 Dai, which translates to a price of 200 Dai\/MKR. <\/li><li>A second keeper bids 50,000 Dai but only requires 230 MKR, which translates to a price of 217 Dai\/MKR. <\/li><li>The bid prices increase through the Keepers\u2019 willingness to take slightly less MKR in exchange for 50,000 Dai. <\/li><\/ul><\/li><li>If no one bids on the first lot of 250 MKR, then the auction can be re-initialized after three days, offering 20% more MKR (300 MKR) for 50,000 Dai, which translates to a price of 166.66 Dai\/MKR.<\/li><li>Finally, if there is at least one bid, and no one outbids it within 6 hours, the auction ends.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone is free to participate in the auction by running an Auction Keeper. Maker provides <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.makerdao.com\/how-to-run-your-own-auction-keeper-bot-in-mcd\/\">documentation on how to run an auction keeper bot<\/a> but no official front-end UI. However, there are some in the community working on making these systems more accessible for the auction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dai Backstop Syndicate<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/backstopsyndicate\"><img src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/backstopsyndicate-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8034\"\/><\/a><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re working with Dharma and many other community members to organize a community-led effort dubbed the <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/backstopsyndicate\">DAI Backstop Syndicate<\/a><\/strong> to form a backstop in support of MKR and act as a buyer of last resort in the upcoming MKR auction.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is to create pool contract that would give syndicate participants a way to participate in the auction process should MKR fall below a given price like 100 DAI \/ MKR.  The intention is to be a backstop, not necessarily buy the MKR nor will it provide liquidity for liquidations during Dai Surplus Auctions (flaps).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The contract will be designed so anyone could trigger an auction using pooled funds at the given price once auctions begin. At which point, all participants would be able to redeem the tokens they minted by supplying Dai for the equiv. Dai \/ MKR blend held by the pool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>If you&#8217;re interested in participating, <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/backstopsyndicate\">join the telegram<\/a> to help organize, review<a href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1miS-snhSYBKwjQHM1MOPnLZZl9i2gj3zTcvuQWecV2M\/edit#\"> the proposal<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/backstop-syndicate\/dai-backstop-syndicate\">Github repo<\/a> for full details<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Nexus Mutual claims<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As of writing this, 3 out of the 11 <a href=\"https:\/\/nexustracker.io\/claims\">submitted claims<\/a> related to the MakerDAO incident have been denied by Nexus Mutual.
