But often times to do that you  need to swap between tokens or stablecoins. Liquidity is an important resource that enables DeFi&#8217;s composability and makes it possible for many DApps to function. It&#8217;s the blood that flows through the veins of DeFi. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a smooth user experience, it&#8217;s essential to have a reliable liquidity at a decent price. DEXes are an obvious choice for reliable liquidity when designing an application or smart contract. However, relying on a single DEX comes with its disadvantages. For example, maybe the token your users want to trade isn&#8217;t listed or has extremely low liquidity causing costly price slippage. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DeFi is all about having options<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If one DEX isn&#8217;t ideal, The obvious answer is to do what DeFi does best with money legos and combine the awesome powers of DEXes. That&#8217;s why we built our other service DEX.AG, a DEX aggregator. DEX.AG&#8217;s X Blaster let&#8217;s you trade multiple DEXes and even splits trades across the combination of DEXes that results in the best price. Each DEX has its strengths, the X Blaster combines those strengths and connects users with the DEX or DEXes that best suits their needs. Not to mention, the X Blaster&#8217;s API has a blazing fast response time that delivers available trades within a fraction of a second so users never wait.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>X Blaster <strong>aggregates liquidity from popular DEXes: <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>0x v3<\/li><li>Bancor<\/li><li>Curve<\/li><li>Kyber<\/li><li>Oasis<\/li><li>Uniswap<\/li><li>Synthetix<br>&#8230;. and more<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With each new update, new tokens, exchanges, and integrations like Compound cTokens and CHAI are added to the X Blaster. We focus on token listings and improving your integrated X Blaster so you can focus on what matters.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Custom fees enable flexible and sustainable business models<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We built DEX.AG because we understand the power of bringing the community together and the value that can create. We see our proxy contracts with custom fees as an opportunity for teams build sustainable models and grow their communities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know how crucial the right business model can be to finding the perfect product-market fit. You choose the custom fees on your X Blaster proxy contract. Developers know their users best and this gives them the flexibility to grow their community on their terms. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>X Blaster in action<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to witness the X Blaster in action?
