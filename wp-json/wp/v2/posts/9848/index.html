The protocol\u2019s tech, which allows the decentralized exchange to feast on the liquidity of other exchanges, is uniquely advantageous for liquidity providers (LPs), so now the race is on to see how many users the project can win over.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DEX in question? <a href=\"https:\/\/integral.link\/deposit\"><strong>Integral<\/strong><\/a>, a new kind of trading protocol that launched in March 2021 and whose team is positioning it to compete with both <em>decentralized <\/em>crypto exchanges like Uniswap and <em>centralized <\/em>crypto exchanges like Coinbase.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>An AMM to Eat All AMMs?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To compete with the exchanges of the world, Integral needs a compelling way to match these exchanges\u2019 liquidity. So what\u2019s one protocol to do against the combined activity of all these other bustling entities?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/eIf2Og4K3j8nNVFL5nJ8Qrc3yjSNhKclKz4MAbECv8qCK547sIaNWCiMagEqyYCMJ-TOXTIUy8TOnYTvUoZPim0CkNq-4NfTbj1Q4Fy4vNr_74rQREUgKhNZj_Sgici290erSZAr\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately for Integral the protocol has an interesting answer, a <strong>new AMM style called an Orderbook AMM, or OB-AMM<\/strong>. What\u2019s special about this style is it allows Integral to \u201cmirror\u201d its competitors\u2019 external liquidity at will, yet with the major advantage of needing just a <em>fraction <\/em>of that liquidity in the project\u2019s own pools.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because of how the OB-AMM model achieves what\u2019s known as <strong>concentrated liquidity<\/strong>, i.e. liquidity that\u2019s distributed along a price range, upon which capital can be condensed in particular places. Integral delivers LPs and traders concentrated liquidity by <strong>decoupling <\/strong><strong><em>capital<\/em><\/strong><strong>, the crypto in the OB-AMM\u2019s pools, from <\/strong><strong><em>depth<\/em><\/strong>, as in an orderbook\u2019s depth or the shapes of pools\u2019 price ranges. The project notably offered this advantage weeks ahead of Uniswap V3, which launched in May 2021 and has since helped popularize concentrated liquidity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh5.googleusercontent.com\/RcOO6tBh5Dq_0_A6E-4QRLO50f1VzBRTUnwmqmiI8d8VuGR1Ecy3THlraM8riVlqNcPkYtO7zz6iUIR-ZrgUMG4XFfeArIDzi1ryi_Wp2IE3vE_OhTG6BslLo2Yt5-mtIp6VO0lH\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Accordingly, Integral can match the world\u2019s exchanges by taking <em>their <\/em>orderbooks and mirroring <em>their <\/em>depth onto Integral\u2019s own pools. This is why Integral currently enjoys +$11B in implied liquidity and same-level price impact while simultaneously having only ~$111.5M in <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/integral\">total value locked (TVL)<\/a> at the moment. It can provide 3x the depth of Binance\u2019s orderbook, for example, and it needs way less liquidity to do so. The ensuing efficiency helps keep price impact lower and LP APYs higher for users.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Impermanent Profit (IP) is here to stay<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two other foundational elements of Integral that make the AMM innovative: the protocol\u2019s <strong>trade delay<\/strong> system and its <strong>mean-0 impermanent loss<\/strong> (IL) system.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Integral\u2019s <em>trade delay<\/em> forces traders to wait 5 minutes + Ethereum\u2019s confirmation time, an implementation that protects LPs from the threat of (IL) caused by arbitrageurs and frontrunners. And <em>mean-0 IL<\/em> entails Integral LPs having IL profiles that oscillate around 0. At times this IL will even become negative, meaning it becomes more profitable to supply an asset to a pool in contrast to just holding it in your wallet, and over time the IL will converge to 0.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The combination of these systems with Integral\u2019s overall efficiency has led to pronounced occasions of what the project\u2019s team is calling <strong><em>impermanent profit<\/em><\/strong><strong> <\/strong>(IP<strong>)<\/strong>. Again, if IL means you would\u2019ve been better off holding your assets than LPing them, <em>IP<\/em> means you ended up better off LPing than you would have by just holding the underlying assets.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/tQ3lQMssk8fCt8YGcx0J__JNKosMufKdj9x6GDPoHYzd4DGESJGM7NxD51pGlB2yMDcdIyw0dGVlQc5px-pYVPUt9972rehX2gijQE3JwOswIUfMOguhnwvCUGp8oumyX9VRqwJf\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, LPs of Integral\u2019s ETH-USDT pool saw <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IntegralHQ\/status\/1396128896542597121\">0.5% impermanent profit<\/a> within the <em>first week<\/em> of the AMM opening up trading to the public. Of course there are no guarantees for how anything will perform over time, but Integral\u2019s efficiencies mean there\u2019s undoubtedly more such profits where those came from for the project\u2019s LPs going forward.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>ITGR pre-farming continues<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This coming June 7th, Integral\u2019s token genesis event (TGE) will take place for the project\u2019s native ITGR token.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, you can already start accruing ITGR rewards by providing liquidity for, or trading through, the AMM\u2019s pools: ETH-WBTC, ETH-DAI, ETH-USDC, ETH-USDT, ETH-LINK, and the project\u2019s newly launched stable pools, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IntegralHQ\/status\/1397608962724294658\">DAI-USDC, DAI-USDT, and USDC-USDT<\/a>. With its concentrated liquidity feature, these new pools are designed to deliver the same stablecoin depth and slippage as some of the biggest pools in DeFi, all while leading the industry in stablecoin trading fee levels at 2 bps.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keep an eye on Integral<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Integral is all but poised to grow from here, as the protocol\u2019s ability to mirror competitors\u2019s liquidity makes its potential considerable. At the same time the project is still young and has plenty of work on its roadmap, so there\u2019s lots more to track from here.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can give <a href=\"https:\/\/integral.link\/swap\">Integral\u2019s trading pools<\/a> a try for yourself when you next have the chance, and if you\u2019re wanting to learn more about this game-changing decentralized exchange then you can stay up to speed by following Integral on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IntegralHQ\">Twitter<\/a> or by participating in Integral\u2019s communities on <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.com\/invite\/GJYCF55Tb6\">Discord<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Disclosure: This post is part of our paid promotional DeFi Pulse Drops series; We\u2019ve partnered with Integral to help educate and inform the community about its OB-AMM technology.
