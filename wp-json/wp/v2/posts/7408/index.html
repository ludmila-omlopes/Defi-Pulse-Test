Up until now, DeFi Pulse only ranks on-chain DeFi projects. But we know that the DeFi community is larger than what\u2019s listed on the leaderboard. And some aspects of our community aren\u2019t as easily measured as a smart contract. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re adding to DeFi Pulse what we call <a href=\"http:\/\/defipulse.com\/defi-list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The DeFi List<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-7423\" src=\"\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/defilist0-300x227.png\" alt=\"The DeFi List\" width=\"600\" height=\"454\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/defilist0-300x227.png 300w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/defilist0-768x581.png 768w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/defilist0.png 852w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The DeFi List is a collection of the best DeFi resources, and a new way for all the DeFi community to grow together.
