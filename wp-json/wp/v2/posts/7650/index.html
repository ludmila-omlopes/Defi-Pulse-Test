In the past, traders used to rely on centralized exchanges to trade using leverage. But recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/what-is-a-dapp\/\">DApps<\/a> that provide this kind of trading have become some of the most popular services in <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/what-is-defi\/\">DeFi<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h1>What is margin trading?<\/h1>\n<p>Margin trading is a method of trading using borrowed funds allowing you further leverage your existing assets. <strong>Margin trading comes with higher risks than normal trading.<\/strong>&nbsp;Because while it does offer the potential to amplify your gains, it can also amplify losses incurred through trading. In traditional finance, brokers typically provide the funds necessary to open a leveraged position. In DeFi, margin traders borrow cryptocurrencies from decentralized lending protocols powered by smart contracts. Lenders<a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/income\"> earn interest rates anywhere from 5-20%<\/a> for lending their tokens to borrowers like margin traders.<\/p>\n<h3>How does it work?<\/h3>\n<p>When you open a margin trade, you select your desired amount of leverage and lock in funds (sometimes referred to as collateral) worth a portion of your total order, also known as your margin. Leverage in this case refers to ratio of borrowed assets to the value of your margin. For example, if you opened a margin trade with 3x leverage worth $3,000, you&#8217;d be required to lock in $1,000 worth of collateral.<\/p>\n<p>Margin trading positions can either by long or short. Opening a long position means you believe that the price will go up. Whereas, opening a short position, also known as shorting, means you believe the price of the asset your trading will go down.<\/p>\n<p>To new traders with little collateral, margin trading can be very appealing because it gives you access to more capital. However, you should be aware that trading with leverage multiplies your profits <em>and your losses<\/em>, meaning that <strong>you should never risk more than you&#8217;re willing to lose<\/strong>. If the value of your margin falls or the price does not go the way you predicted and your trade becomes over-leveraged, your margin trade can be liquidated and your collateral can be sold to repay the assets you borrowed plus interest.<\/p>\n<h1>Top Margin Trading Platforms in DeFi<\/h1>\n<p>DeFi margin trading platforms are built using smart contracts which enforce trading rules and facilitate the loans between lenders and borrowers, or rather margin traders in this case. When you margin trading cryptocurrency on any of these platforms, you will pay interest on any assets that you borrow. Potential leverage and borrowing interest rates vary from platform to platform. And, the interest you pay is subject to fluctuation depending on the platform&#8217;s available supply and demand for loans.<\/p>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-7661\" src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Selection_225-1024x504.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"315\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Selection_225-1024x504.jpg 1024w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Selection_225-300x148.jpg 300w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Selection_225-768x378.jpg 768w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Selection_225-1536x756.jpg 1536w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Selection_225-1568x772.jpg 1568w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/Selection_225.jpg 1918w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><\/h3>\n<h3>dYdX<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dydx.exchange\/\">dYdX<\/a>&nbsp;is a non-custodial trading platform geared toward experienced traders which offers trades with up to 5x leverage on longs and 4x leverage on shorts. dYdX is the largest margin trading platform in DeFi with <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/dydx\">over $23 million worth of assets locked<\/a> into its smart contracts.
