When I studied abroad in Milan, I had the chance to attend Bitcoin 2014, the annual Bitcoin conference. I listened to many of the technical presentations, met early companies like Coinbase and figures like Charlie Lee. I left that event convinced crypto was going to change the financial\/legal industries to same way that the internet changed media and communications industries.<\/p>\n<p>Since then, I&#8217;ve gone down the rabbit hole, working at 21.co, starting an angel syndicate called Turing Capital, and since then Set.<\/p>\n<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?<\/h3>\n<p>Set is a protocol that makes fund strategies easy and accessible. We built TokenSets, which is the first interface where you can acquire a Set with a few clicks of a button. Today, you can get simple strategies like an Index and more complicated technical analysis strategies like a Moving Average Crossover.&nbsp;Recently, we launched Set Social Trading on TokenSets which allows traders to effectively tokenize their strategies. Users can buy into traders Sets and gain automated exposure to their strategy.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?<\/h3>\n<p>The amateur investor or trader would find our products useful &#8211; those who understand the power of implementing a strategy, but don&#8217;t necessarily have the knowledge, effort, or skills to do it.<\/p>\n<h3>What future event or feature on your road map are you most excited for?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"answer__Wrapper-sc-1k75oj5-1 jpwJZg\">\n<div class=\"Split-sc-3xe4fi-0 answer__BlockSplit-sc-1k75oj5-4 jdjoQR\">\n<div class=\"SplitItem-sc-3xe4fi-1 cReNwR\">We&#8217;re most excited about onboarding more Social Traders and continuing to release more robo Sets onto the TokenSets platform.<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>Where do you see your project, product, or service fitting into the future of DeFi?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"answer__Wrapper-sc-1k75oj5-1 jpwJZg\">\n<div class=\"Split-sc-3xe4fi-0 answer__BlockSplit-sc-1k75oj5-4 jdjoQR\">\n<div class=\"SplitItem-sc-3xe4fi-1 cReNwR\"><span class=\"Text-wqps8m-0 text-value__ValueText-di8e7l-0 gDygKs fs-block\" data-qa=\"response-answer\">We hope our product serves as a fundamental primitive for automated trading and asset management.<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3><span class=\"Text-wqps8m-0 answer__QuestionText-sc-1k75oj5-0 jWxpxy\" data-qa=\"response-question\">What\u2019s something in DeFi that you think more people should be paying attention to?<\/span><\/h3>\n<div class=\"Spacer-cjod5i-0 frBWpl\">\n<div class=\"answer__Wrapper-sc-1k75oj5-1 jpwJZg\">\n<div class=\"Split-sc-3xe4fi-0 answer__BlockSplit-sc-1k75oj5-4 jdjoQR\">\n<div class=\"SplitItem-sc-3xe4fi-1 cReNwR\"><span class=\"Text-wqps8m-0 text-value__ValueText-di8e7l-0 gDygKs fs-block\" data-qa=\"response-answer\">Asset Management Primitives!<\/span><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<h3>How can readers learn more about your product\/service?<\/h3>\n<div>Find us on twitter at <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/SetProtocol\">@SetProtocol<\/a> or join our <a href=\"https:\/\/t.me\/joinchat\/Fx8D6wyprLUlM1jMVnaRdg\">Telegram<\/a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.gg\/x3PGVfP\">Discord<\/a>.
