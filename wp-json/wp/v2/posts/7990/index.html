Every single DAI in existence has been generated by users <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/maker\">locking collateral into Maker&#8217;s smart contract system<\/a> and opening what&#8217;s called a Vault.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you open a Maker Vault, you lock in collateral such as ether (ETH) or BAT. And then, you\u2019re able to generate or borrow up to 2\/3 of the US dollar value of your collateral in DAI. In other words, your Vault&#8217;s ratio of collateral value to total debt in DAI must be above 150%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For every 1 DAI, there is at least $1.50 worth of collateral locked into a Maker Vault. And if your collateral value falls, you must lock in more ETH, pay back some of your debt, or risk having the collateral in your Vault liquidated. When a Vault position is liquidated, the held collateral is automatically sold to pay back the debts in addition to a penalty fee for failing to keep your collateral ratio above 150%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using Maker&#8217;s Oasis portal to borrow your first DAI<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Navigate to Maker&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/oasis.app\/borrow\">Oasis Borrow<\/a>.<\/strong><br>There are many ways to interface with a Maker Vault; Oasis is <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/OasisDEX\">open-source<\/a> and was developed by the Maker. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Connect the wallet of your choice and click &#8216;Get Started&#8217;<\/strong><br><a href=\"https:\/\/metamask.io\/\">MetaMask<\/a> is a browser extension commonly recommended for interacting with many DApps.

You can spend, save, lend, and tons more with your DAI. You can trade DAI for ETH, MKR, and many other ERC20 tokens at the best prices in DeFi using a DEX aggregator like <a href=\"https:\/\/dex.ag\/\">DEX.AG<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/income\">earn interest<\/a> by lending out your DAI on other DeFi lending protocols. Remember to keep in mind the stability fees you&#8217;ll owe on any DAI you generate or borrow from your Vault. And also, consider the various risks involved in lending some of which we cover in our <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/zero-to-defi-cdai\/\">Zero to DeFi<\/a> guide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to earn interest is to deposit DAI into Maker&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/dsr-dai-savings-rate\/\">Dai Savings Rate<\/a> (DSR). The DSR allows users to lock in DAI to earn a variable interest rate. However, don&#8217;t go generating DAI just to deposit it into the DSR because the DSR is designed to be lower than the stability fee. <a href=\"https:\/\/oasis.app\/save\">Learn more<\/a> about the Dai Savings Rate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;d be surprised the many interesting ways you can use your DAI!
