This time we had the chance to talk with Sunil Srivatsa, Founder of <a href=\"http:\/\/saddle.finance\">Saddle<\/a>, about the lessons he&#8217;s learned about importance of community and the power of memes while building their AMM.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Q1-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9026\" width=\"1200\" height=\"220\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">We\u2019re building Saddle, an automated market maker for pegged value crypto assets, like tokenized bitcoin, stablecoins, or ETH derivatives.&nbsp; The team is currently wrapping up work on V1 Virtual Swaps (powered by Synthetix), which will enable large, low slippage trades between any type of asset supported by Saddle.&nbsp; These types of swaps suffer from a common flaw on L1 though, which is that they break existing aggregator integrations (e.g. 1inch, Matcha) since they are multi-step trades.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Saddle solves this by being co-located with Synthetix on Optimism\u2019s L2 scalability stack &#8211; we just recently performed our first test trades on Optimism!&nbsp; By porting our Virtual Swap contracts to Optimism, we\u2019ll be able to offer these same swaps with instant settlement and lower transaction fees, which also makes smaller trades viable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Another key differentiator that sets us apart from similar offerings is that all of our code has been open sourced under a permissive license.&nbsp; We\u2019ve since seen several other well known projects build upon our work, including Sushiswap V3, Nerve on Binance Smart Chain, and Snowball on Avalanche!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Q2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9030\" width=\"1200\" height=\"220\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Q2.png 1200w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Q2-300x55.png 300w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Q2-1024x188.png 1024w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Q2-768x141.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Different use cases will have different priorities when it comes to tradeoffs between security, scalability, and decentralization.&nbsp; <strong>In decentralized finance, applications are handling large amounts of capital and user funds, and security is generally the most important consideration.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Security lapses, especially ones that involve the loss of funds, are some of the worst events for a protocol\u2019s reputation.&nbsp; The security of user funds is our top priority, which is why we conducted three back-to-back smart contract audits with Certik, Quantstamp, and Open Zeppelin before launching Saddle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>A common place where you can see this tradeoff in action is how many protocols have a smaller multisig with admin key capabilities for emergency situations<\/strong> (e.g. temporarily pausing trades if a vulnerability is found).&nbsp; In these cases, protocols are trading decentralization for security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Q6.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9134\" width=\"1200\" height=\"220\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Q6.png 1200w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Q6-300x55.png 300w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Q6-1024x188.png 1024w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Q6-768x141.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>It\u2019s vital that community members feel ownership and a sense of belonging.&nbsp; <\/strong>Compound\u2019s launch of the COMP governance token in June of last year revolutionized community ownership by introducing the concept of giving away network equity to users.&nbsp; This approach was iterated on by Andre Cronje, who popularized the \u201cfair launch\u201d when releasing Yearn.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Contrast this with traditional businesses, where ownership is usually only available to tenured employees or a privileged few.&nbsp;<strong> This new ownership and equity paradigm makes it significantly easier to grow tight knit communities with aligned incentives.<\/strong>&nbsp; Some examples of awesome communities are the Chainlink Marines and Synthetix Spartans.&nbsp; We\u2019re in the early days here at Saddle, and I\u2019m incredibly excited for what the future holds for all of us!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Q3-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9031\" width=\"1200\" height=\"220\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">Decentralized autonomous organizations, or DAOs.&nbsp; I fell down the DAO and governance rabbit hole in June 2020 when I co-founded Urza DAO, a for-profit DAO focused on staking and liquidity mining opportunities.&nbsp; The DAO has since grown to 24 members and ~$3.5MM in crypto assets under management and I\u2019ve learned a bunch along the way.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-medium-font-size\">DAOs are an exciting new coordination mechanism and we\u2019re just starting to explore what\u2019s possible with them.&nbsp;
