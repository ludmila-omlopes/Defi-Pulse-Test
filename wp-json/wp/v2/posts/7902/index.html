It turned out there was and I&#8217;ve been involved with Ethereum and smart contracts ever since.<\/p>\n<p>I started working on Sablier after getting my paycheck delayed by a few days. Mind you, I was working at a crypto startup, so I asked myself why do we have to use these legacy payment systems when smart contracts can be as fast as &#8230; real-time?<\/p>\n<h3>What are you building and what sets it apart?<\/h3>\n<p>Building Sablier, the protocol for real-time finance. Just like you can stream music on Spotify, so you can stream money on Sablier.<\/p>\n<p>As far as I know, we are the first Ethereum project to have implemented a money streaming protocol that is production-ready and is accompanied by a nice user interface.<\/p>\n<h3>Who do you view as the ideal user or customer for your product or service?<\/h3>\n<div class=\"answer__Wrapper-sc-1k75oj5-1 cdoaIi\">\n<div class=\"Split-sc-3xe4fi-0 answer__BlockSplit-sc-1k75oj5-4 dSektV\">\n<div class=\"SplitItem-sc-3xe4fi-1 hqqccI\">\n<p><span class=\"Text-wqps8m-0 text-value__ValueText-di8e7l-0 jZTfRo fs-block\" data-qa=\"response-answer\">DeFi people, particularly freelancers and gig workers, but we have bigger plans for the long term.
