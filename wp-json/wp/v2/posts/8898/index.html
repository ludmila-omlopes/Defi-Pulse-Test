One could make the case that the popularity of tokenized dollars in crypto was a necessary precursor to the DeFi ecosystem we know today. Their liquidity and relative stability enabled new possibilities for smart contracts which ultimately led to the rapid maturity in decentralized financial instruments built on-chain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we\u2019re happy to unveil our new <a href=\"http:\/\/defipulse.com\/usd\">Cryptodollars<\/a> page dedicated to measuring the amount of tokenized dollars in DeFi. At the time of writing, the total value locked in cryptodollars exceeds $34.5B. This new addition to DeFi Pulse helps to capture the full picture of the extraordinary growth of DeFi with years of historical data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"defipulse.com\/usd\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"574\" height=\"289\" src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/cryptodollars.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8924\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/cryptodollars.png 574w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/cryptodollars-300x151.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 574px) 100vw, 574px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>At launch, the following cryptodollars will be included: USDT, USDC, DAI, BUSD, PAX, HUSD, TUSD, sUSD, GUSD, MUSD, and DUSD<\/em><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do we define each type of cryptodollar?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Custodial &#8211; a USD token backed by USD held in custody by a third party<\/li><li>Collateralized &#8211; a token pegged to USD backed by another asset or basket of assets<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019d also like to take a moment to acknowledge algorithmic stablecoin communities and the innovations happening in that sector.
