Our collective endeavors are etched into the blockchain; our stories and shared history can be found in our data.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask anyone who&#8217;s familiar with DeFi and they&#8217;ll tell you that it&#8217;s been exhilarating to be a part of. Week by week, we&#8217;ve crossed milestones, set new records, and broken new ground. We set goals and then build towards them until they are fulfilled. Our community takes data from the blockchain and translates it into meaningful events that represent our community&#8217;s story and what it values.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Concourse Open, we&#8217;ve witnessed this firsthand with our Total Value Locked metric. When we built DeFi Pulse a little over a year ago, we could have never imagined how well it would be received by the community. So many stories have been told with our data and illustrated with our charts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Total Value Locked (TVL) in <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/hashtag\/DeFi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DeFi<\/a> &#8212; Last 365 Days <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/FOZY4UxLlq\">pic.twitter.com\/FOZY4UxLlq<\/a><\/p>&mdash; Spencer Noon \ud83d\udd5b (@spencernoon) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/spencernoon\/status\/1246482345710010370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 4, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote><script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n<\/div><figcaption><em>Graphic made using data from DeFi Pulse Data<\/em><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We want everyone to have access to the data they need. <a href=\"https:\/\/data.defipulse.com\/\">DeFi Pulse Data<\/a> combines its popular DeFi metrics with data from Concourse Open&#8217;s other popular services&#8217; APIs like ETHGasStation and Rekto which thousands of users, websites, and applications rely upon everyday to understand the decentralized ecosystem.
