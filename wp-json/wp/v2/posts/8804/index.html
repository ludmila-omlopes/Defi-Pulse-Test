When you look back at the year, it\u2019s honestly hard to wrap your head around how much things have changed in our community. There are so many projects that launched this year that have become core to the foundation of decentralized finance. Many new projects rose to fill the needs of the ecosystem and many more challenged our preconceived notions of what was thought possible or where DeFi was headed at the start of the year. To round out the year, we thought it would be best to take a moment to celebrate the Top Builders in DeFi of 2020 as nominated by you in our first ever community survey. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Top Builders in DeFi of 2020<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Without further ado, here are the results:<br><br>Andre Cronje won DeFi&#8217;s MVP builder, engineer, and top project lead of 2020. Fellow YFI proponent Banteg came in second for the top engineer in DeFi of 2020.<br><br>Argent won the top UX\/UI of 2020 with honorable mentions going to both DeFi Saver and Synthetix.<br><br>Ryan Sean Adams won DeFi&#8217;s top communications lead of 2020.<br><br>Anthony Sassano won DeFi&#8217;s top community manager of 2020.<br><br>As many guessed, Samczun won DeFi&#8217;s top white hat hacker and top auditor of 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kudos to all of you and your hard work! DeFi wouldn\u2019t be what it is today without your contributions!<br><br>Now on a more personal level, we\u2019d like to highlight the ways we here at DeFi Pulse have grown in 2020.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>DeFi Pulse Adapters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It feels like forever ago that we released the <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ConcourseOpen\/DeFi-Pulse-Adapters\">open source adapter framework<\/a> that now powers our metrics on the DeFi Pulse leaderboard in February 2020. In the past, we had to learn each project and code their adapters ourselves. This new framework allowed projects to collaborate with our team making the listing process faster and ensuring TVL metrics were measured accurately. This year alone we more than doubled the number of projects on DeFi Pulse, listing close to 40 new projects in 2020 (not including any updates to existing projects): <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/aave\">Aave<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/alpha-homora\">Alpha Homora<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/auctus\">Auctus<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/balancer\">Balancer<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/b.protocol\">B.Protocol<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/c.r.e.a.m.-finance\">C.R.E.A.M.

With more than $14B TVL currently, this was a year of massive growth across all DeFi categories. We saw the birth of dozens of new projects, the emergence of new ways of distributing ownership to the community, the consolidation of open orgs as a novel coordination system, and massive technological experimentation that brought tremendous innovation to DeFi. One can&#8217;t help but wonder what DeFi&#8217;s growth will be in 2021 and what new innovations we will witness. But one thing is for sure, though: these are still very early days, and we&#8217;re only beginning to see what the future of finance will look like.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh3.googleusercontent.com\/dMVfoTQwv0JVf-_X611Isx86nm_aTyYieJGC2i_bMFA6hCGOhPOcsT4lLG3E_AiRoc6t83_61_uu6jGEBjKJQqNdE_Dsb7Yt-Dq7y6MPCJgmORoCmEXCMoPRWdi-Gl5zqncapmNV\" width=\"458\" height=\"231\"><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems hard to believe that we were celebrating that the <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/1-billion-tvl-in-defi\/\">(TVL) had hitted the $1B<\/a> mark for the first time less than one year ago.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>DeFi Pulse Data<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In April 2020, we<a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/see-the-bigger-picture-with-defi-pulse-data\/\"> released<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/data.defipulse.com\/\">DeFi Pulse Data<\/a> combining DeFi Pulse\u2019s popular metrics with data from Concourse Open\u2019s other popular services\u2019 APIs like <a href=\"https:\/\/ethgasstation.info\/\">ETHGasStation<\/a>. Whether you\u2019re writing a blog post analyzing DeFi or building an application that needs accurate gas prices from ETH Gas Station, any task benefits from the right information. We\u2019ve been thrilled to see what the community has done with our data at their disposal.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>DeFi Pulse Drops<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We launched DeFi Pulse Drops, a promotional series where we partnered with projects to inform the community about their latest features, releases, and builds. All in all, we provided in-depth analysis of the following projects throughout 2020: <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/futureswap\/\">Futureswap<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/balancer-start-liquidity-mining-and-earn-bal-tokens-today\/\">Balancer<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/mcdex\/\">MCDEX<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/introducing-mstable\/\">mStable<\/a>, Rari Capital <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/rari-capital\/\">v1<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/rari-capital-v2\/\">v2<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/aco\/\">Auctus<\/a>\u2019s ACO, Akropolis\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/delphi\/\">Delphi, Perpetual Protocol<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/lien\/\">Lien<\/a>, Hakka\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/3f-mutual\/\">3F Mutual<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/dextf\/\">DEXTF<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/deversifi-nectar-beehive-v1\/\">DeversiFi<\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/harvest-finance-drop\/\">Harvest Finance<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>DeFi Pulse Farmer<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This year\u2019s most important trend within the DeFi space was, without a doubt, <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/the-yield-farming-frenzy-and-its-impact-on-defi\/\">yield farming<\/a>. Ignited by the launch of the COMP governance token in June, farming developed into one of the key strategies most projects relied on to attract capital to their platforms. By distributing ownership of their protocols to the DeFi community via liquidity incentives in the form of governance tokens, projects grew the liquidity of their platforms exponentially, making the TVL break all-time highs consistently during most weeks of Q3 and Q4.<br><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/ZmckhJ5sGa2qwaeDds0vUdEHjjJvKk1Rx1Fh4mK4frzcfO42WtTjPBbHMCTTkCjenkiOFIe2ImQKiCVd1I_Jwo3xrhjlP3W7cw6SCJzEl8EA_-6_Pz0i6Wo1PZjpsmZr--tl_-oS\" width=\"624\" height=\"112\"><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early August, we launched the <a href=\"https:\/\/yieldfarmer.substack.com\/\">DeFi Pulse Farmer newsletter<\/a> to extensively cover this massive trend and get to the heart of the most critical innovations in the space. Currently at edition #21, DeFi Pulse Farmer also offers premium subscribers access to the Alpha Tractor and Protocol Express series.

DeFi Pulse Index was the first of its kind, an index of decentralized finance that wasn\u2019t synthetic or a derivative but rather you own the underlying DeFi tokens and can redeem them using your DPI. Much like our Total Value Locked (TVL) metrics, we aimed to make DeFi Pulse Index a standard the community could stand behind. At the time of writing, DPI is the leading DeFi index token with 5769 holders and a market capitalization of over $25M.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh4.googleusercontent.com\/ynAyW6qEsjl34s5yIgXBL5v8iL5vS51SntCYOaWKtALa0b965ZZwNLkFQ9ZG92h2TxqN1iJUS8woB6vuM0zNNT5FOFXfxhrynwy7tSFlB4D5aLa3VQJbQXeU15rBY_qB0mk4vJFf\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2020, the <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/introducing-the-defi-pulse-economic-safety-grade\/\">DeFi Pulse Economic Safety Grade was released in partnership with Gauntlet<\/a> and added to <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/compound\">Compound<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/aave\">Aave<\/a>\u2019s project pages on DeFi Pulse. As the name implies, each Economic Safety Grade is a 1 to 100 grade that allows users to more easily quantify and compare the economic risks of using on-chain protocols. Grades are created by running simulations utilizing data from centralized and decentralized exchanges combined with on-chain user data to estimate market risks. For a more in-depth explanation of the simulation model, we recommend you read this <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/gauntlet-networks\/understanding-risk-in-defi-f64574593979\">blog post from Gauntlet<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bitcoin at Work<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Marking the last major release for DeFi Pulse in 2020, our team <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/introducing-bitcoin-at-work\/\">unveiled a new page <\/a>highlighting the use of Bitcoin in the DeFi ecosystem called <a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/btc\">Bitcoin at Work<\/a>. We worked with 10 different teams from all across the industry to support a wide variety of BTC tokens at launch including: WBTC, RENBTC, HBTC, sBTC, tBTC, imBTC, oBTC, acBTC, pBTC, and BTC++. Thanks again to the team\u2019s who coordinated with us on this launch. Aside from recognizing the hard work and growth of this sector, we hope the metrics and information included in this new page will help DeFi users discover new possibilities and make more informed decisions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/lh6.googleusercontent.com\/espfahPdgGdQCx3GUwVEmNd8Wv4-D10oKwYZAAF_pE0S4g1qx3acdEDloF_CNTh3_Nj3YCY9DwLT-2ZcPqAwaa9vnpw3Kzr1t75tegsI3h34BBXF8plgJjnVAB-cBAYxM0cEDbU6\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/btc\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to each and every one of you reading this. With all the flashy numbers and tech, it can be easy to forget that DeFi begins and ends with the people that make up this community. There would be no value, liquidity, or any other metrics to measure without the time and attention each one of us dedicates to building a brighter future together. Our team\u2019s resolution for 2021 is to keep working with project communities to highlight the awesome work being done in this space with the platform we\u2019ve been given by you.
