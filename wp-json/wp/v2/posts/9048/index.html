Inspired by their previous work on DDEX, the DODO team set out to abstract the proactive market making concepts popular on order book-based exchanges into a permissionless on-chain liquidity protocol.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dodoex.io\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"375\" src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-1024x375.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9050\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-1024x375.png 1024w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-300x110.png 300w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-768x282.png 768w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-1536x563.png 1536w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-2048x751.png 2048w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/logo-dodo_iaaauaya_-1-1568x575.png 1568w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>DODO\u2019s Proactive Market Making (PMM) algorithm in action<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To fully grasp what makes proactive market making different, take a step back and ask yourself: what is a market? A simple definition of a market is a place where you can exchange assets. A single trade doesn\u2019t make a market; it is the constant distillation, distribution, and reaction to the data produced by buyers and sellers\u2019 orders and trades that makes a market. Much of this data is typically represented by the ever-changing collection of orders being placed, removed, and executed from an exchange\u2019s order books.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional Automated Market Maker (AMM) DEXes automate the process of market making by pooling liquidity for two assets and replacing the order books with a simple fixed curve to determine the current price based on the current amount of each asset held. As the name implies, DODO\u2019s Proactive Market Making algorithm is capable of proactively adjusting parameters such as asset ratio and curve slope in anticipation of market conditions, resulting in DODO pools that are adaptable and flexible for all sorts of use cases.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>DODO\u2019s PMM pools can even be configured to utilize external price oracles to minimize impermanent loss and achieve higher capital efficiency. This configurability makes DODO\u2019s PMM suitable for use cases varying from single-sided liquidity for bootstrapping pools to fully customizable market making strategies that adapt to market conditions in realtime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of breaking down the math, let\u2019s explore the <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/dodoex\/dodo-private-pool-professional-market-making-on-chain-b18a282596e3\">DODO Private Pool (DPP)<\/a>, a feature aimed at professional market makers that best illustrates what makes DODO\u2019s PMM algorithm special. If you\u2019re interested in the formula behind DODO\u2019s PMM, you can dig into the math <a href=\"https:\/\/dodoex.github.io\/docs\/docs\/math\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DODO Private Pool (DPP) puts you, the market maker, in control<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DODO Private Pools put the full power of DODO\u2019s PMM configurability at your fingertips empowering anyone to be a professional market maker. DPP allows market makers to do the following:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Make one-sided deposits \/ withdrawals<\/li><li>Change the pricing curve at any time<\/li><li>Have liquidity everywhere in the price range from zero to infinity<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you want to be a market maker for ETH\/USDC but you\u2019re worried about ETH popping off and selling all your ETH to traders on the way up. With a DPP, you can perform a one-sided withdrawal to withdraw some of your ETH from the pool for safekeeping. This one-sided reduction of liquidity causes traders to go through the remaining ETH liquidity quickly driving up the price curve quicker than before. This sort of one-sided withdrawal can protect market makers against excessive risk. You can also do the opposite: withdraw USDC in anticipation of ETH\u2019s price falling thus protecting you against the downside risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>Unlike a simple AMM, DODO Private Pools allow you as a market maker to customize your strategy, taking advantage of your human brain to actively influence a pool\u2019s behavior. <\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Say, for example, you feel the current market price of an asset doesn\u2019t reflect its true value. In this scenario, you aren\u2019t likely to provide liquidity for a simple AMM pool and may even remove liquidity for that asset to avoid impermanent loss. This is because you cannot directly influence the price at which the pool is selling the asset. DODO Private Pools provide a better way with a process called \u2018active price discovery\u2019 which allows you to adjust the market price inside the DPP directly. Ultimately, market makers\u2019 ability to actively influence the price discovery process allows them to utilize their knowledge, experience, and intuition to craft a more efficient market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-default\"><p>DODO Private Pools can even allow you to create specialized markets like constant price markets for low slippage stable asset swaps. <\/p><p>This is achieved by market makers setting a DPP\u2019s k value to a very small non-zero value (e.g. k = 0.001) to get an \u201capproximately constant\u201d pricing curve not dissimilar to stablecoin swaps on Curve Finance.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While DODO\u2019s PMM and Private Pools sure are interesting, this dodo isn\u2019t nearly finished evolving. DODO has lots more features and upgrades planned for this year. We\u2019ll be covering more DODO features in the future.
