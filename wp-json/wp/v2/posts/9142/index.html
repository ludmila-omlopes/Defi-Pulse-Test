To become a guru, you must be able to take in your surroundings to gain perspective and glean greater wisdom. DexGuru wants to be your guide lighting the way through the dark forest. <a href=\"https:\/\/dex.guru\/\">DexGuru<\/a> harmonizes permissionless, real-time data and analytics of every on-chain market in a single UI capable of trading across DEXes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trade with more awareness with real-time on-chain market data<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s 2021.

It means you can copy and paste any token address into DexGuru\u2019s search bar and tap into loads of information generated from analysis of on-chain trading activity for free.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/dex.guru\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/dexguru-ui-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9147\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/dexguru-ui-1024x576.png 1024w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/dexguru-ui-300x169.png 300w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/dexguru-ui-768x432.png 768w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/dexguru-ui-1536x864.png 1536w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/dexguru-ui-1568x882.png 1568w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/dexguru-ui.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We might be biased towards the color purple here but&#8230; DexGuru is rather sleek looking, combining various data feeds into a responsive and appealing UI\/UX. View charts and trading data in real-time for any token as trades occur to stay more informed with what\u2019s happening on-chain. Want to know more about the token you\u2019re viewing? Simply click the DYOR button at the top of the page and get a rundown of that token\u2019s basic info and community links. Beyond price and trade history, traders and farmers alike can utilize real-time liquidity data to monitor when liquidity is added or removed from pools. Not to mention, DexGuru can give you insights into the behaviors of other traders in the market, but we\u2019ll get to that later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Become one with the flow &#8211; executing trades on multiple chains from one UI<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the hood, DexGuru uses the 0x API to provide users with gas-efficient order routing.

In other words, when it is added to the DEX, it\u2019s added to DexGuru. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trade orders are routed through any 0x API connected exchange including Uniswap, Kyber, Curve, Balancer, CREAM, Bancor, mStable, Shell, Swerve, SnowSwap, SushiSwap, DODO, Mooniswap(1inch protocol AMM), PancakeSwap, BakerySwap, Mooniswap, DODO_V2, SushiSwap, Nerve Finance, Belt Finance, and Ellipsis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gain more insight with DexGuru\u2019s real-time on-chain analytics<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most interesting features DexGuru has to offer is the deeper analysis it performs on user trading history. DexGuru is constantly monitoring on-chain markets for new trades. When a new trade is received, DexGuru analyzes the trader\u2019s address and marks it with a special emoji in the pool activity or trading history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"345\" height=\"342\" src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-9150\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image.png 345w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-300x297.png 300w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/image-150x150.png 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\ud83d\udc22 &#8211; Casual Trader with $10k-$100k of a trading volume last 30 days<br>\ud83e\udd88 &#8211; Active Trader with $100k-$500k of a trading volume last 30 days<br>\ud83d\udc33 &#8211; Heavy Trader with $500k+ of a trading volume last 30 days<br>\ud83e\udd16 &#8211; Trader with 1000+ TXs in last 30 days.
