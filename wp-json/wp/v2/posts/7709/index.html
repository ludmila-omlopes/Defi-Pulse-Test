Don&#8217;t worry, because we&#8217;ve put together this quick guide to give you jump start.<\/p>\n<h2>Start making money on DeFi in 4 steps<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with Ethereum, these steps will only take a few minutes. And when it&#8217;s all said and done, you&#8217;ll be earning interest in DAI every block.\u00a0<em><strong>However if you&#8217;re completely new to Ethereum,<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0you may instead want to check out\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/defipulse.com\/blog\/zero-to-defi-cdai\/\">Zero to DeFi<\/a><\/strong>, a beginner&#8217;s guide which breaks down the entire process of getting a wallet, acquiring ETH, and lending out your DAI.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Get ETH into an address that you own<\/h3>\n<p>As the saying goes, if you don&#8217;t hold the private keys to the wallet, then they aren&#8217;t your coins. So, be sure to perform these steps from a wallet that you hold the private keys to. And, don&#8217;t forget to keep them backed up somewhere safe.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Head to\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/dex.ag\/\">DEX.AG<\/a> and sell most of that ETH for DAI<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/DEX.AG\">DEX.AG<\/a> is a decentralized exchange or DEX aggregator that gets you the best price available from several of the most popular DEXes. It even splits your trade across multiple DEXes if it improves the price, all in one transaction.\u00a0<strong>Make sure to leave a little ETH leftover for <a href=\"https:\/\/ethgasstation.info\/blog\/what-is-gas\/\">gas fees<\/a>.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/dex.ag\/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-7722\" src=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Selection_300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Selection_300.jpg 1000w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Selection_300-300x300.jpg 300w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Selection_300-150x150.jpg 150w, http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/Selection_300-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/a><\/h3>\n<h3>3.

Pick a lending protocol, and start earning interest<\/h3>\n<p>Enter the asset and amount you wish to lend to find which lending protocol has the best interest rate. Pick a protocol and click the &#8216;Next&#8217; button which will redirect you to that app\/service. Compound finance is currently the most popular lending protocol. Follow the app&#8217;s instructions to begin lending out your DAI and start earning interest.<\/p>\n<h3>And then later, when you&#8217;re ready to cash out&#8230;<\/h3>\n<p>Head back to the lending protocol you chose and use your private key to unlock the DAI plus interest generated whenever you want. There&#8217;s no &#8220;lock-in&#8221; period or time you have to wait before earning interest. Your DAI is earning interest every block until you choose to stop.<\/p>\n<p><em>Still have questions?\u00a0<\/em>Come chat us in our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/discord.gg\/y7qSf4A\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord<\/a> and stay up-to-date on the world of DeFi by following us on <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/defipulse\">Twitter.<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Decentralized finance (DeFi) is changing the way people interact with their money.\u00a0 However, we know it can be a lot&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":7729,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[5,8,9,17],"tags":[59,64,66,75,82,87,88,155],"amp_validity":null,"amp_enabled":true,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7709"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7709"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7709\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":9323,"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7709\/revisions\/9323"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7729"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7709"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7709"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/127.0.0.1\/wordpress\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7709"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
